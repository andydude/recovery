<i>**Charlie**: Step 2 says, "We came to believe that a power greater ourselves could restore us to sanity." Well if we're going to be restored to sanity, then that indicates that we must be insane. And many alcoholics are highly offended when you bring this up. They say, "Oh don't tell me I'm insane. Yeah, I do some pretty crazy stupid things when drinking, but when I'm sober, I'm much like normal people." Other alcoholics say, "Well I don't have any trouble with this insanity because I remember the crazy stupid things while drinking." In either case they're refering to stupid things we do while drunk. No, that's not insanity. The stupid things we do while drunk, that is caused by a mind that is filled with alcohol, which lowers the inhibitions. And if you're mind is filled with something that lowers your inhibitions, look out, you're going to do some pretty crazy stupid things, alright.
</i>

<i>**Joe**: That's why they give out all that free booze out.
</i>

<i>**Charlie**: That's not insanity, that's caused by alcohol itself. In order for us to understand this, we finally had to go back to the dictionary again, to look up the word sanity or the word sane. And It's defined in the dictionary as wholeness of mind or completeness of mind. If your mind is whole, if your mind is complete that means you can see the truth about everything around you. You will normally make decisions then based on truth and life turns out to be pretty good. An insane mind is one that is less than whole. A mind that is less than whole cannot always see the truth about everything around it. Sometimes makes a decision based upon a lie and then life becomes pretty lousy. To be insane does not mean you're crazy. If you're crazy that means you've lost more than half your marbles and you gotta be locked up somewhere to protect you and society from you. That's craziness, but insanity is just less than whole. I think one of the best ways I know to illustrate it is just, let's take a pie. Set it here in front of us. Let's cut that pie into 10 pieces. You come along and I give you a piece of pie. My pie is now less than whole, but hell I've still got 90% of it. Somebody else comes along I give a piece of pie. My pie is now more or less whole but I still got 80% of it. Insanity does not mean you're all gone, it just means you're not quite all here. And when it comes to alcohol, from time to time, it seems as though we're not quite all here. Because we can't always see the truth about alcohol. We make a decision based upon a lie. Then we run into the truth and life because an absolute living hell. So let's look within the mind of we alcoholics, just before we take the first drink. Stone cold sober. Can we, or can we not see the truth? If we can see the truth, then we're sane, and if we can't we're insane. Now Bill is going to show us by a series of examples. He's going to give us the man of 30, he's going to look at Jim, he's going to look at the jay walker, and he's going to look at Fred. And each time we're going to look into the mind to see if we can or cannot see the truth about alcohol. Let's look at it for just a few minutes.
</i>

<i>**Joe**: The chapter is called More about Alcoholism. It could be called More Truth about Alcoholism. I've heard all my life that if you know the truth, the truth will set you free. And if you're not free, it's because you don't know the truth. And this chapter here is to ygive me more truth. So I can base my life upon truth rather than upon things that are not true.
</i>

**Bill (read by Joe)**: Most of us have been unwilling to admit we were real alcoholics. No person likes to think he is bodily and mentally different from his fellows. Therefore, it is not surprising that our drinking careers have been characterized by countless vain attempts to prove we could drink like other people. The idea that somehow, someday he will control and enjoy his drinking is the great obsession of every abnormal drinker. The persistence of this illusion is astonishing. Many pursue it into the gates of insanity or death.

**Bill (read by Joe)**: We learned that we had to fully concede to our innermost selves that we were alcoholics. This is the first step in recovery. The delusion that we are like other people, or presently may be, has to be smashed.

<i>**Charlie**: Now be careful, in these two paragraphs that Joe just read he has used 4 different words that all mean the same thing. And if you catch him at it, then you know what he's doing, if you don't, you'll think he's talking about something else. 
</i>

<p class="text-muted">
**Bill (read by Charlie)**: The idea that somehow, someday he will control and enjoy his drinking is the great obsession of every abnormal drinker.
</p>

<i>**Charlie**: Now we know an obsession is an idea that is so strong that it can make you believe something that's not true. It can make you believe a lie.
</i>

<p class="text-muted">
**Bill (read by Charlie)**: The persistence of this illusion is astonishing.
</p>

<i>**Charlie**: We know what an illusionist is. An illusionist is a magician and they can stand in front of you and with a slight of hand and a few props, they can make you believe something that's not true. So illusion also means to believe something that's not true, or to believe a lie.
</i>

<p class="text-muted">
Many pursue it into the gates of insanity or death.
</p>

<i>**Charlie**: Insanity is to believe something that's not true. In the next paragraph he said
</i>

<p class="text-muted">
The delusion that we are like other people, or presently may be, has to be smashed.
</p>

<i>**Charlie**: Delusion means the same thing. If you've deluded yourself it means you've come to believe something that's not true. So you may see him using any one of four terms: obsession, illusion, delision, or insanity. All four mean exactly the same thing. To believe something that is not true, or to believe a lie. Let's go over to page 32, second paragraph. Let's look at the lie the man of 30 believed.

### Incomprehensible demoralization (AR)

<div class="text-muted">
We alcoholics are men and women who have lost the ability to control our drinking. We know that no real alcoholic ever recovers control. All of us felt at times that we were regaining control, but such intervals--usually brief--were inevitably followed by still less control, which led in time to pitiful and incomprehensible demoralization. We are convinced to a man that alcoholics of our type are in the grip of a progressive illness. Over any considerable period we get worse, never better.

We are like men who have lost their legs; they never grow new ones. Neither does there appear to be any kind of treatment which will make alcoholics of our kind like other men. We have tried every imaginable remedy. In some instances there has been brief recovery, followed always by a still worse relapse. Physicians who are familiar with alcoholism agree there is no such thing a making a normal drinker out of an alcoholic. Science may one day accomplish this, but it hasn't done so yet.

Despite all we can say, many who are real alcoholics are not going to believe they are in that class. By every form of self-deception and experimentation, they will try to prove themselves exceptions to the rule, therefore nonalcoholic. If anyone who is showing inability to control his drinking can do the right-about-face and drink like a gentleman, our hats are off to him. Heaven knows, we have tried hard enough and long enough to drink like other people!

Here are some of the methods we have tried: drinking beer only, limiting the number of drinks, never drinking alone, never drinking in the morning, drinking only at home, never having it in the house, never drinking during business hours, drinking only at parties, switching from scotch to brandy, drinking only natural wines, agreeing to resign if ever drunk on the job, taking a trip, not taking a trip, swearing off forever (with and without a solemn oath), taking more physical exercise, reading inspirational books, going to health farms and sanitariums, accepting voluntary commitment to asylums--we could increase the list ad infinitum.

We do not like to pronounce any individual as alcoholic, but you can quickly diagnose yourself. Step over to the nearest barroom and try some controlled drinking. Try to drink and stop abruptly. Try it more than once. It will not take long for you to decide, if you are honest with yourself about it. It may be worth a bad case of jitters if you get a full knowledge of your condition.

Though there is no way of proving it, we believe that early in our drinking careers most of us could have stopped drinking. But the difficulty is that few alcoholics have enough desire to stop while there is yet time. We have heard of a few instances where people, who showed definite signs of alcoholism, were able to stop for a long period because of an overpowering desire to do so. Here is one.
</div>

### Once an alcoholic, always an alcoholic (PLBB)

**Bill (read by Joe)**: A man of thirty was doing a great deal of spree drinking. He was very nervous in the morning after these bouts and quieted himself with more liquor. He was ambitious to succeed in business, but saw that he would get nowhere if he drank at all. Once he started, he had no control whatever. He made up his mind that until he had been successful in business and had retired, he would not touch another drop. An exceptional man, he remained bone dry for twenty-five years and retired at the age of fifty-five, after a successful and happy business career. Then he fell victim to a belief which practically every alcoholic has -- that his long period of sobriety and self-discipline had qualified him to drink as other men. Out came his carpet slippers and a bottle. In two months he was in a hospital, puzzled and humiliated. He tried to regulate his drinking for a little while, making several trips to the hospital meantime. Then, gathering all his forces, he attempted to stop altogether and found he could not. Every means of solving his problem which money could buy was at his disposal. Every attempt failed. Though a robust man at retirement, he went to pieces quickly and was dead within four years.

**Bill (read by Joe)**: This case contains a powerful lesson. Most of us have believed that if we remained sober for a long stretch, we could thereafter drink normally. But here is a man who at fifty-five years found he was just where he had left off at thirty. We have seen the truth demonstrated again and again: "Once an alcoholic, always an alcoholic." Commencing to drink after a period of sobriety, we are in a short time as bad as ever. If we are planning to stop drinking, there must be no reservation of any kind, nor any lurking notion that someday we will be immune to alcohol.

<i>**Charlie**: Now we know the truth to be this: "Once an alcoholic, always an alcoholic." We've never seen one single case where one of us was able to go back to successful drinking. Now to believe anything different than that is to believe something that is not true, or to believe a lie. This guy believed that after 25 years of sobriety he could now drink like normal people. Based upon that belief, he took a drink, triggered the allergy, couldn't stop, 4 years later he's dead. Now his real problem though the fact that he has physical allergy to alcohol, or a form of insanity that tells him it's okay to drink alcohol after 25 years of sobriety. The real problem centers in our mind telling us we can drink rather than in our body that ensures that we can't drink. Let's go to page 34.

### Peculiar mental twist (AR)

<div class="text-muted">
Young people may be encouraged by this man's experience to think that they can stop, as he did, on their own will power. We doubt if many of them can do it, because none will really want to stop, and hardly one of them, because of the peculiar mental twist already acquired, will find he can win out. Several of our crowd, men of thirty or less, had been drinking only a few years, but they found themselves as helpless as those who had been drinking twenty years.

To be gravely affected, one does not necessarily have to drink a long time nor take the quantities some of us have. This is particularly true of women. Potential female alcoholics often turn into the real thing and are gone beyond recall in a few years. Certain drinkers, who would be greatly insulted if called alcoholics, are astonished at their inability to stop. We, who are familiar with the symptoms, see large numbers of potential alcoholics among young people everywhere. But try and get them to see it! **

As we look back, we feel we had gone on drinking many years beyond the point where we could quit on our will power. If anyone questions whether he has entered this dangerous area, let him try leaving liquor alone for one year. If he is a real alcoholic and very far advanced, there is scant chance of success. In the early days of our drinking we occasionally remained sober for a year or more, becoming serious drinkers again later. Though you may be able to stop for a considerable period, you may yet be a potential alcoholic. We think few, to whom this book will appeal, can stay dry anything like a year. Some will be drunk the day after making their resolutions; most of them within a few weeks.
</div>

### How to tell if you are an alcoholic (PLBB)

**Bill (read by Charlie)**: For those who are unable to drink moderately the question is how to stop altogether. We are assuming, of course, that the reader desires to stop. Whether such a person can quit upon a nonspiritual basis depends upon the extent to which he has already lost the power to choose whether he will drink or not. Many of us felt that we had plenty of character. There was a tremendous urge to cease forever. Yet we found it impossible. This is the baffling feature of alcoholism as we know it--this utter inability to leave it alone, no matter how great the necessity or the wish.

**Bill (read by Charlie)**: How then shall we help our readers determine, to their own satisfaction, whether they are one of us? The experiment of quitting for a period of time will be helpful, but we think we can render an even greater service to alcoholic sufferers and perhaps to the medical fraternity. So we shall describe some of the mental states that precede a relapse into drinking, for obviously this is the crux of the problem.

**Bill (read by Charlie)**: What sort of thinking dominates an alcoholic who repeats time after time the desperate experiment of the first drink? Friends who have reasoned with him after a spree which has brought him to the point of divorce or bankruptcy are mystified when he walks directly into a saloon. Why does he? Of what is he thinking?

**Bill (read by Charlie)**: Our first example is a friend we shall call Jim. 

<i>**Charlie**: And we're going to look into Jim's mind just before he gets drunk and we're going to see if he is sane or insane. Joe loves Jim.
</i>

<i>**Joe**: I love little Jim. I identified with Jim.
</i>

<p class="text-muted">
**Bill (read by Joe)**: Our first example is a friend we shall call Jim. 
</p>

**Bill (read by Joe)**: This man has a charming wife and family. He inherited a lucrative automobile agency. He had a commendable World War record. He is a good salesman. Everybody likes him. 

<i>**Charlie**: Typical alcoholic isn't he?
</i>

**Bill (read by Joe)**: He is an intelligent man, normal so far as we can see, except for a nervous disposition. He did no drinking until he was thirty-five. In a few years he became so violent when intoxicated that he had to be committed. On leaving the asylum he came into contact with us.

**Bill (read by Joe)**: We told him what we knew of alcoholism 

<i>**Charlie**: They told him about step 1, the physical allergy, the obsession of the mind, the powerless condition.
</i>

**Bill (read by Joe)**: and the answer we had found. 

<i>**Charlie**: They told him about step 2, the power greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity.
</i>

**Bill (read by Joe)**: He made a beginning. 

<i>**Charlie**: Step 3 is just a beginning, so apparently Jim took steps 1, 2, and 3, and immediately things started to get better for him.
</i>

**Bill (read by Joe)**: His family was re-assembled, and he began to work as a salesman for the business he had lost through drinking. All went well for a time, but he failed to enlarge his spiritual life. 

<i>**Charlie**: The book is going to tell us the only way we enlarge on step 3 is 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12, and Jim didn't do any of those. He did one, two, and three.
</i>

**Bill (read by Joe)**: To his consternation, he found himself drunk half a dozen times in rapid succession. On each of these occasions we worked with him, reviewing carefully what had happened. 

<i>**Charlie**: Oh, these were good A.A. members. Jim got drunk 6 times in a row. Each time they went over there and worked with him, carefully reviewing what had happened. If you get drunk six times in a row today, they probably won't have anything to do with you. These were good solid A.A. members. 
</i>

**Bill (read by Joe)**: He agreed he was a real alcoholic and in a serious condition. He knew he faced another trip to the asylum if he kept on. Moreover, he would lose his family for whom he had a deep affection.

**Bill (read by Joe)**: Yet he got drunk again. We asked him to tell us exactly how it happened. 

<i>**Charlie**: They're getting a little tired of Jim now. They said "My God Jim, this is 7 times in a row! Let's don't go through this anymore. You sit down here, and you tell us exactly how this has happened."
</i>

<i>**Joe**: On page 36 we're going to see where Jim was sane, and then we're going to see where he went insane.
</i>

**Bill (read by Joe)**: This is his story: 

**Jim (read by Joe)**: "I came to work on Tuesday morning." 

<i>**Charlie**: We read this story for years before we saw this
</i>

<p class="text-muted">
**Jim (read by Charlie)**: "I came to work on Tuesday morning." 
</p>

<i>**Charlie**: Where was he all day Monday? We're bad about Monday.
</i>

**Jim (read by Joe)**: "I remember I felt irritated that I had to be a salesman for a concern I once owned." 

<i>**Charlie**: I don't think that's insanity, that's probably normal thinking. I think any of us had to be a salesman for a concern we once owned, we'd probably be a little irritated by that fact, too. That's normal sane thinking.
</i>

**Jim (read by Joe)**: "I had a few words with the brass, but nothing serious." 

<i>**Charlie**: Probably said, "Say, Jim, by the way, where were you all day yesterday, anyhow." Nothing serious, just enough to irritate him.
</i>

<i>**Joe**: He's a little restless, a little irritated, and a little discontented. He said
</i>

**Jim (read by Joe)**: "Then I decided to drive to the country and see one of my prospects for a car." 


<i>**Charlie**: What's more normal than if you're a car salesman, you want to get away from the shop for awhile, drive out in the country, see somebody that we already know that we're trying to sell a car to. That would be normal sane thinking for an alcoholic car salesman.
</i>

**Jim (read by Joe)**: "On the way I felt hungry so I stopped at a roadside place where they have a bar. I had no intention of drinking. I just thought I would get a sandwich."

<i>**Charlie**: What's more normal than if you're hungry, to stop in a roadside place to get a sandwich the fact that they got a bar there is besides the point. We have no intention of drinking. We're hungry, we're going to get a sandwich. Normal sane thinking for an alcoholic car salesman.
</i>

**Jim (read by Joe)**: "I also had the notion that I might find a customer for a car at this place, which was familiar for I had been going to it for years. I had eaten there many times during the months I was sober." 

<i>**Charlie**: We're not going in there to drink. We've eaten there many times during the months we're sober. We're going to go in there and get a sandwich, and maybe sell a car while we're in there. Normal sane thinking for an alcoholic car salesman.
</i>

**Jim (read by Joe)**: "I sat down at a table and ordered a sandwich and a glass of milk."

**Jim (read by Charlie)**: "Still no thought of drinking." 

<i>**Charlie**: What's more normal than to sit down at a table and order a sandwich, and a glass of milk. Normal sane thinking for an alcoholic car salesman.
</i>

**Jim (read by Joe)**: "I ordered another sandwich and decided to have another glass of milk."

<i>**Charlie**: If you're hungry enough there's nothing wrong with two sandwiches and two glasses of milk. Unless you're a member of overeaters anonymous you'd better look at it. But that would be normal sane thinking for an alcoholic car salesman. Two sandwiches, two glasses of milk. Now comes the Squiggley writing.
</i>

<i>**Joe**: That's italic.
</i>

### The experiment went so well (AR)

**Jim (read by Joe)**: "<em class="bg-warning">Suddenly the thought crossed my mind that if I were to put an ounce of whiskey in my milk it couldn't hurt me on a full stomach."</em>

<i>**Charlie**: This is absolute insanity isn't it. For this guy to believe that he can take whiskey, mix it with milk and take it on a full stomach and it won't hurt him. Now based on the insane idea, he makes a decision and takes some action.
</i>

**Jim (read by Joe)**: "<em class="bg-warning">I ordered a whiskey and poured it into the milk. I vaguely sense I was not being any too smart, but I felt reassured as I was taking the whiskey on a full stomach."</em> 


<i>**Charlie**: Now we've got it inside of ourselves, the physical allergy takes over. Now then we can't stop.
</i>

**Jim (read by Joe)**: "The experiment went so well that I ordered another whiskey and poured it into more milk. That didn't seem to bother me so I tried another."

<i>**Joe**: Can you imagine how he's going to feel with whiskey and the milk, back and forth.
</i>

<i>**Charlie**: What a hangover he's going to have.
</i>

**Bill (read by Joe)**: Thus started one more journey to the asylum for Jim. Here was the threat of commitment, the loss of family and position, to say nothing of that intense mental and physical suffering which drinking always caused him. <em class="bg-warning">He had much knowledge about himself as an alcoholic. Yet all reasons for not drinking were easily pushed aside in favor of the foolish idea that he could take whiskey if only he mixed it with milk!</em>

**Bill (read by Joe)**: Whatever the precise definition of the word may be, we call this plain insanity. How can such a lack of proportion, of the ability to think straight, be called anything else?

<i>**Joe**: If you were looking for a definition of insanity, that would be it right there: The lack of the ability to think straight, to be called anything else.
</i>

<i>**Charlie**: Now Jim's real is the fact that he has a physical allergy to alcohol, and he has a form of insanity that tell him it's okay to drink alcohol mixed with milk on a full stomach. The real problem centers in the mind telling us we can drink rather than in the body that ensures that we can't. Page 37 last paragraph.
</i>

***[Skip](#passion-for-jay-walking-ar)***

### The mind of an alcoholic (PLBB)

<div class="text-muted">
You may think this an extreme case. To us it is not far-fetched, for this kind of thinking has been characteristic of every single one of us. We have sometimes reflected more than Jim did upon the consequences. But there was always the curious mental phenomenon that parallel with our sound reasoning there inevitably ran some insanely trivial excuse for taking the first drink. Our sound reasoning failed to hold us in check. The insane idea won out. Next day we would ask ourselves, in all earnestness and sincerity, how it could have happened.

In some circumstances we have gone out deliberately to get drunk, feeling ourselves justified by nervousness, anger, worry, depression, jealousy or the like. But even in this type of beginning we are obliged to admit that our justification for a spree was insanely insufficient in the light of what always happened. We now see that when we began to drink deliberately, instead or casually, there was little serious or effective thought during the period of premeditation of what the terrific consequences might be.
</div>

### Passion for jay-walking (AR)

**Bill (read by Charlie)**: Our behavior is as absurd and incomprehensible with respect to the first drink as that of an individual with a passion, say, for jay-walking. 

<i>**Charlie**: Now I don't understand this guy at all. But I can see him out here on the interstate, waiting for a truck or a bus to come down through there, jumps out in front of it spins around 2 or 3 times, see how close it can come to hitting him without actually hitting him. For some reason he gets thrill out of it. I don't understand him, but I can see him doing it.
</i>

<p class="text-muted">
**Bill (read by Charlie)**: He gets a thrill out of skipping in front of fast-moving vehicles. 
</p>

**Bill (read by Charlie)**: He enjoys himself for a few years in spite of friendly warnings. 


<i>**Charlie**: People say Bill, you better quit doing that, you're going to get yourself hurt.
</i>

**Bill (read by Charlie)**: Up to this point you would label him as a foolish chap having queer ideas of fun. Luck then deserts him and he is slightly injured several times in succession. 

<i>**Charlie**: He's getting a little older, now, he can't move as fast, and they begin to hit him once in awhile. Nothing serious, he just kinda bounces off of them.
</i>

**Bill (read by Charlie)**: You would expect him, if he were normal, to cut it out. Presently he is hit again and this time has a fractured skull. 

<i>**Charlie**: Now he got hurt bad this time.
</i>

**Bill (read by Charlie)**: Within a week after leaving the hospital a fast-moving trolley car breaks his arm. 

<i>**Charlie**: He gets hurt bad again. Now he sings our national anthem.
</i>

**Bill (read by Charlie)**: He tells you he has decided to stop jay-walking for good, 

<i>**Charlie**: He says, man, I'll never do that again as long as I live.
</i>

**Bill (read by Charlie)**: but in a few weeks he breaks both legs.

**Bill (read by Charlie)**: On through the years this conduct continues, accompanied by his continual promises to be careful or to keep off the streets altogether. Finally, he can no longer work, 

<i>**Charlie**: He's so beat up now that he can't hold a job.
</i>

**Bill (read by Charlie)**: his wife gets a divorce and he is held up to ridicule. 

<i>**Charlie**: She's starting to support him and the kids and the hospital bills.
</i>

**Bill (read by Charlie)**: He tries every known means to get the jay-walking idea out of his head. 

<i>**Charlie**: Not his body, his head.
</i>

**Bill (read by Charlie)**: He shuts himself up in an asylum, hoping to mend his ways. But the day he comes out he races in front of a fire engine, which breaks his back. Such a man would be crazy, wouldn't he?

**Bill (read by Charlie)**: You may think our illustration is too ridiculous. But is it? We, who have been through the wringer, have to admit if we substituted alcoholism for jay-walking, the illustration would fit exactly. However intelligent we may have been in other respects, where alcohol has been involved, we have been strangely insane. It's strong language--but isn't it true?

<i>**Charlie**: Oh, I think that's so appropriate, today. You know, once again, because of that education many many people are getting to us before they have to lose everything. Occationally you see somebody come in here that's still married. Once in awhile they come in and they've got a job. Believe it or not, I saw one come in about a month ago and he still had an automobile. And we start talking to those people about insanity. And they say "Don't tell me I'm crazy. I haven't lost anything, I've got my job, I've got my bla bla bla." We're not talking about that at all. We're talking about one thing and one thing only. Can we or can we not see the truth about alcohol. If we can, we're sane, if we can't, we're insane.

<i>**Charlie**: Now the low bottom drunk like Jim, probably easier for him to see his insanity. Because he lost everything that he had, period. A high-bottom drunk, hasn't lost a lot of stuff. Sometimes it's a little more difficult for them to see it. But I'll tell you whether you're low-bottom or high-bottom, if you get drunk, you're going to get drunk the same way. Believing something that is not true. Let's go to page whatever the next one is, page 39. My pages are so tore up I can't read it anymore. And we're going to look at a guy named Fred. 
</i>

***[Skip](#drinking-without-thinking-plbb)***

### Certain nonalcoholic people (AR)

<div class="text-muted">
Some of you are thinking: "Yes, what you tell is true, but it doesn't fully apply. We admit we have some of these symptoms, but we have not gone to the extremes you fellows did, nor are we likely to, for we understand ourselves so well after what you have told us that such things cannot happen again. We have not lost everything in life through drinking and we certainly do not intend to. Thanks for the information."

That may be true of certain nonalcoholic people who, though drinking foolishly and heavily at the present time, are able to stop or moderate, because their brains and bodies have not been damaged as ours were. But the actual or potential alcoholic, with hardly any exception, will be ABSOLUTELY UNABLE TO STOP DRINKING ON THE BASIS OF SELF-KNOWLEDGE. This is a point we wish to emphasize and re-emphasize, to smash home upon our alcoholic readers as it has been revealed to us out of bitter experience. Let us take another illustration.
</div>

### Drinking without thinking (PLBB)

<i>**Charlie**:  And we're going to look at a guy named Fred. Now Fred is the opposite of Jim, Fred is high-bottom. Fred never lost anything. Jim didn't feel too good the day he got drunk. Fred is on top of the world the day he gets drunk. Yet he got drunk the same way. He believed a lie. Let's look at Fred's lie.
</i>

**Bill (read by Joe)**: Fred is a partner in a well known accounting firm. His income is good, he has a fine home, is happily married and the father of promising children of college age. He has so attractive a personality that he makes friends with everyone. If ever there was a successful business man, it is Fred. To all appearance he is a stable, well balanced individual. Yet, he is alcoholic. We first saw Fred about a year ago in a hospital where he had gone to recover from a bad case of jitters. It was his first experience of this kind, and he was much ashamed of it. Far from admitting he was an alcoholic, he told himself he came to the hospital to rest his nerves. 

<i>**Charlie**: We see lots of nerve resters here in A.A. today, just like old Fred is.
</i>

**Bill (read by Joe)**: The doctor intimated strongly that he might be worse than he realized. For a few days he was depressed about his condition. He made up his mind to quit drinking altogether. It never occurred to him that perhaps he could not do so, in spite of his character and standing. Fred would not believe himself an alcoholic, 

<i>**Charlie**: He would not take step 1.
</i>

**Bill (read by Joe)**: much less accept a spiritual remedy for his problem. 

<i>**Charlie**: If you can't take 1, then you can't take 2.
</i>

**Bill (read by Joe)**: We told him what we knew about alcoholism. 

<i>**Charlie**: They told him about step 1 and step 2
</i>

**Bill (read by Joe)**: He was interested and conceded that he had some of the symptoms, 

<i>**Charlie**: He said I'm a little bit alcoholic, borderline case.
</i>

**Bill (read by Joe)**: but he was a long way from admitting that he could do nothing about it himself. He was positive that this humiliating experience, plus the knowledge he had acquired, would keep him sober the rest of his life. Self-knowledge would fix it.

**Bill (read by Joe)**: We heard no more of Fred for a while. One day we were told that he was back in the hospital. This time he was quite shaky. He soon indicated he was anxious to see us. The story he told is most instructive, for here was a chap absolutely convinced he had to stop drinking, who had no excuse for drinking, who exhibited splendid judgment and determination in all his other concerns, yet was flat on his back nevertheless.

**Bill (read by Joe)**: Let him tell you about it: 

**Fred (read by Joe)**: "I was much impressed with what you fellows said about alcoholism, and I frankly did not believe it would be possible for me to drink again. I rather appreciated your ideas about the subtle insanity which precedes the first drink, but I was confident it could not happen to me after what I had learned. I reasoned I was not so far advanced as most of you fellows, that I had been usually successful in licking my other personal problems, and that I would therefore be successful where you men failed. I felt I had every right to be self-confident, that it would be only a matter of exercising my will power and keeping on guard.

**Fred (read by Joe)**: "In this frame of mind, I went about my business and for a time all was well. I had no trouble refusing drinks, and began to wonder if I had not been making too hard work of a simple matter. One day I went to Washington to present some accounting evidence to a government bureau. I had been out of town before during this particular dry spell, so there was nothing new about that. Physically, I felt fine. Neither did I have any pressing problems or worries. My business came off well, I was pleased and knew my partners would be too. It was the end of a perfect day, not a cloud on the horizon.

<i>**Joe**: Everything is on top of the world for old Fred. He's doing great. He's making lots of money, family happy, business associates are happy, everything is good in his life.
</i>

**Fred (read by Charlie)**: "I went to my hotel and leisurely dressed for dinner. AS I CROSSED THE THRESHOLD OF THE DINING ROOM, THE THOUGHT CAME TO MIND THAT IT WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE A COUPLE OF COCKTAILS WITH DINNER. 


<i>**Charlie**: And go back to the hospital. Now that's the truth, isn't it? No way could he drink on the truth. His mind said 
</i>

<p class="text-muted">**Fred (read by Charlie)**: It would be nice to have a couple of cocktails with dinner.
</p>

**Fred (read by Charlie)**: THAT WAS ALL. NOTHING MORE. 

<i>**Charlie**: Now based on the insane idea, he makes a decision, takes some action.
</i>

**Fred (read by Charlie)**: I ordered a cocktail and my meal. Then I ordered another cocktail. 

<i>**Charlie**: And we've got it inside ourselves now. The allergy takes over.
</i>

**Fred (read by Charlie)**: After dinner I decided to take a walk. When I returned to the hotel it struck me a highball would be fine before going to bed, so I stepped into the bar and had one. I remember having several more that night and plenty next morning. I have a shadowy recollection of being in a airplane bound for New York, and of finding a friendly taxicab driver at the landing field instead of my wife. The driver escorted me for several days. I know little of where I went or what I said and did. Then came the hospital with the unbearable mental and physical suffering.

**Fred (read by Charlie)**: "As soon as I regained my ability to think, I went carefully over that evening in Washington. NOT ONLY HAD I BEEN OFF GUARD, I HAD MADE NO FIGHT WHATEVER AGAINST THE FIRST DRINK. THIS TIME I HAD NOT THOUGHT OF THE CONSEQUENCES AT ALL. I had commenced to drink as carelessly as thought the cocktails were ginger ale. 

<i>**Charlie**: Now, is Fred's real problem the fact that he has a physical allergy to alcohol, or that he has a form of insanity that tells him it's okay to have a couple of cocktails with dinner. The reall problem centers in the mind telling us that we can drink, rather than in the body that ensures that we can't. Page 43 last paragraph.

### All this (AR)

<div class="text-muted">
I now remembered what my alcoholic friends had told me, how they prophesied that if I had an alcoholic mind, the time and place would come--I would drink again. They had said that though I did raise a defense, it would one day give way before some trivial reason for having a drink. Well, just that did happen and more, for what I had learned of alcoholism did not occur to me at all. I knew from that moment that I had an alcoholic mind. I saw that will power and self-knowledge would not help in those strange mental blank spots. I had never been able to understand people who said that a problem had them hopelessly defeated. I knew then. It was the crushing blow.

"Two of the members of Alcoholics Anonymous came to see me. They grinned, which I didn't like so much, and then asked me if I thought myself alcoholic and if I were really licked this time. I had to concede both propositions. They piled on me heaps of evidence to the effect that an alcoholic mentality, such as I had exhibited in Washington, was hopeless condition. They cited cases out of their own experience by the dozen. This process snuffed out the last flicker of conviction that I could do the job myself.

"Then they outlined the spiritual answer and program of action which a hundred of them had followed successfully. Though I had been only a nominal churchman, their proposals were not, intellectually, hard to swallow. But the program of action, though entirely sensible, was pretty drastic. It meant I would have to throw several lifelong conceptions out of the window. That was not easy. But the moment I made up my mind to go through with the process, I had the curious feeling that my alcoholic condition was relieved, as in fact it proved to be.

"Quite as important was the discovery that spiritual principles would solve all my problems. I have since been brought into a way of living infinitely more satisfying and, I hope, more useful than the life I lived before. My old manner of life was by no means a bad one, but I would not exchange its best moments for the worst I have now. I would not go back to it even if I could."

Fred's story speaks for itself. We hope it strikes home to thousands like him. He had felt only the first nip of the wringer. Most alcoholics have to be pretty badly mangled before they really commence to solve their problems.

Many doctors and psychiatrists agree with our conclusions. One of these men, staff member of a world-renowned hospital, recently made this statement to some of us: "What you say about the general hopelessness of the average alcoholics' plight is, in my opinion, correct. As to two of you men, whose stories I have heard, there is no doubt in my mind that you were 100% hopeless, apart from divine help. Had you offered yourselves as patients at this hospital, I would not have taken you, if I had been able to avoid it. People like you are too heartbreaking. Though not a religious person, I have profound respect for the spiritual approach in such cases as yours. For most cases, there is virtually no other solution."

<i>**Joe**: Bill had the idea that self-knowledge would fix it.
 Rowland Hazard had the idea that self-knowledge would fix it.
 Fred had the idea that self-knowledge would fix it.
Bill is trying to show us here that they all have the obsession of the mind. He's trying to show us through the illustrations of The Man of Thirty, Jim, Jay-Walker, and Fred to tell us one thing: The last paragraph says:
</i>

**Bill (read by Joe)**: Once more

<i>**Joe**: He went through all this to say
</i>

**Bill (read by Joe)**: <span class="text-muted">Once more:</span> The alcoholic at certain times has no effective mental defense against the first drink. Except in a few cases, neither he nor any other human being can provide such a defense. His defense must come from a Higher Power.

<i>**Joe**: And that is the solution. So you can't heal a sick mind with a sick mind. Self-knowledge won'y get it. The more we try to think our way out of it the deeper we get into it. It must come from a Higher Power, our defense must come from a Higher Power.
</i>

<i>**Charlie**: You notice he didn't say the practicing alcoholic, nor the drinking alcoholic, he just said the alcoholic. What that means to me today is that I have no effective mental defence against the first drink. Left on my own resources, invariably I'm going to go right back to drinking again without the aid of a Power greater than human power.

Now, if you're the kind of alcoholic that I am and if were raised in the church setting that I was raised in. By the end of Chapter 3 you are now faced with one hell of a dillema. Because he's convinced me in Chapter 3 without the aid of a Power greater than I am, I'm going to go back to drinking. But I also felt that even though that was true, it wouldn't be possible for me to get the aid of a Power greater than I am. Because you see like Joe, I was raised in a good old Southern Baptist Church. Now I've got nothing against Southern Baptist Church, it's a great church, but when I was a kid growing up, I'm sure that from time to time they talked about a kind and loving God. But if they did, the message never got to the pew I sat in. Because all I remember hearing about God when I was growing up in church was hail, fire, and brimstone. Going to hell for lying and cheating and stealing and drinking whiskey and committing adultery. By the time I got to A.A. I've been doing that for 20 some odd years. And I know that God had already told Saint Peter when that little 4 eyed sucker gets here send him downstairs we'll not need his kind. And I knew that if God had anything to do with me it wouldn't be anything good, it would almost certainly be something bad. I remember so clearly when I separated from God. In that Baptist church I grew up in they gave me the rules. They said if you do this, this, this you'll be okay. If you do that, that, that, then you're going to hell just as sure as anything. Now I didn't have any trouble with their rules at all, until I got to be about 12 or 13 years old. One day it seems to me that the preacher looked me straight in the eye and he said, "To think about doing it is just as bad as doing it." And I said, "Oh, shit." I've had it now, because I'd been thinking about doing it for a long time. In fact I'd been thinking about doing it long enough I was starting to get brain damage from it. And I said, "If you're going to hell for thinking about it, then you might as well go ahead and do it." And I did, and I didn't go to hell immediately, and I said that sucker has been lying to me all along. I said, "He and my parents and my teachers have formed together in a conspiracy to keep me from having any fun." And I said, "From this day on I do not indent to pay any attention to what they have to say I don't have any intention of following God's rules, their rules, or anybody else's rules. From this day on I'm going to do it my way and I'm going to do it whenever I want to, and if they don't like it, to hell with them." And when I got to A.A. I had that attitude of a 12 year old buy who had defied God, his parents and his teachers. When I first walked into A.A. I was 38 years old, with a spiritual knowledge of God of that 12 year old boy. No wonder we have trouble with this God thing when we get to A.A. Anybody else ever have those feelings about God and people? And I think Bill recognized that, and he said, "sooner or later I'm going to have to ask these people to make a decision about God." And I think he thought in his mind that they weren't able to make that decision based upon old ideas. And that's what I had when I got here, old ideas. I think he said I believe I need to give them some new information about God. Where they might be able to discard some old ideas, and pick up some new ideas, and then they'll be able to make a decision about this God thing. And he wrote another chapter called "We Agnostics." Which I think is one of the greatest pieces of spiritual information I've ever read in my life. As I read that and studied that, I can see where some of my old ideas, prejudices about God and religion were wrong. And where I could see where they were wrong, then I could discard them, and then I could accept some new ideas about God, and then I could make a decision. Based on hail, fire, and brimstone, based on a God of justice, no way I would ever have made a decision about God.
