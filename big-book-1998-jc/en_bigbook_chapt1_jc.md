<i>
**Charlie**: Last night we spent quite a bit of time talking about the problem--talking about the physical allergy that ensures we can't safely drink--talking about the obsession of the mind that ensures that we can't keep from drinking, and the ultimate conclusion of that was if you can't safely drink without getting drunk, and you can't keep from drinking, then you've become absolutely powerless over alcohol, and most certainly our lives have become unmanageable--if not at that time, then maybe just keep on drinking and after awhile, they will be for sure.
</i>

<i>
**Charlie**: So this morning we're going to look at an example of a guy that had that problem. A good textbook never tells you anything that it don't back up with more information. We're going to look at Bill's Story this morning. And Bill's Story is a classic example of an alcoholic who had the allergy, had the obsession of the mind. Now we have to remember back in the 1930s, Bill learned very early on the value of sharing your story with another alcoholic. When he went to see Dr. Bob, and immediately Dr. Bob could see his problem also. They went to see Bill D. and they shared their story with Bill D. Bill D. could see his problem through their stories, and they learned very learly on that was necessary for one alcoholic to identify with another in order to be able to get their interest and get their attention. When the Big Book was first published, they knew that they wouldn't be able to sit down with the first person out here in California and share their story one on one. So the Big Book had to be complete enough to do that. So they said we'll put Bill's Story right here at the very beginning. and another alcoholic in reading Bill's Story will be able to identify with Bill, and if we can identify with Bill, and see his alcoholism--see him make a recovery from that condition, then we can begin to believe, and we can begin to hope that if we are like Bill Wilson, and if he can recover from that condition, then just maybe we could too.
</i>

<i>
**Charlie**: 
Now a lot of people have said we have trouble identifying with Bill Wilson, because after all he was a night school lawyer, and we were not. After all he was a New York city stock speculator, and we were not. A lot of the women said we can't identify with him because he's a man. Many people said "He was an older fellow," and we couldn't identify there either. But if we look for way Bill thinks, and the way bill acts, and the way Bill drinks, and if we're a real alcoholic, then there's not an alcoholic in this room who can't identify with Bill Wilson. So as we go through Bill's Story this morning we'll look for identification<!--/C/Identify-->, we'll look for the progression of alcoholism<!--/C/Progressive = LIV-4 --> , we'll look for him drinking, and finally for the sickest reason of all, complete oblivion, and we'll look and see how Bill recovers from alcoholism. And if we've identified with him, and can begin to believe, and he could do it, then just maybe could too. Identification--the beginning of belief--the beginning of hope. Joe?
</i>

<i>
**Joe**: I too didn't identify with Bill Wilson, but I've seen pictures of him and he was an old man, I thought. Turns out he was 43 years old when this book was written, so a relatively young man. As I began to study and read Bill's Story, I began to see how he was optimistic person, hard working, had lots of will power, he was a self made man, and very successful in his own right. Throughout Bill's Story, we're going to see how, what he was like, how he learned he was sick, and then we're going to see how he effected his recovery. So the whole story of Alcoholic's Anonymous is contained in Bill Wilson's story. So let's go to page 1. Bill's Story
</i>

**Bill (read by Joe)**: War fever ran high in the New England town[^town] to which we new, young officers from Plattsburg[^from] were assigned, and we were flattered when the first citizens took us to their homes, making us feel heroic. Here was love, applause, war; moments sublime with intervals hilarious[^with]. 

[^town]: **Andrew**: The New England town was probably Boston.
[^from]: **Andrew**: This city is spelled "Plattsburgh" today.
[^with]: **Andrew**: In the original manuscript, the phrase was "hilarious intervals", but the previous phrase "moments sublime" has the opposite structure (Noun first, adjective second) and so it makes sense to correct this to match.

<i>
**Joe**: Anyone have moments sublime with intervals hilarious? I love the way Bill writes.
</i>

**Bill (read by Joe)**: I was part of life at last, and in the midst of the excitement I discovered liquor. <span class="bg-warning">I forgot the strong warnings and the prejudices of my people concerning drink.</span> In time we sailed for "Over There." I was very lonely and again turned to alcohol.

**Bill (read by Joe)**: We landed in England. I visited Winchester Cathedral. Much moved, I wandered outside. My attention was caught by a doggerel on an old tombstone:

<blockquote>
"Here lies a Hampshire Grenadier
Who caught his death
Drinking cold small beer.
A good soldier is ne'er forgot
Whether he dieth by musket
Or by pot."
</blockquote>

<i>
**Charlie**: Now when he said "or by pot" he's not refering to this wacky weed, he's talking about a pot of beer, that's the way they used to drink it over in England at that time.
</i>

**Bill (read by Joe)**: <span class="bg-warning">Ominous warning--which I failed to heed.</span>

**Bill (read by Joe)**: Twenty-two, and a veteran of foreign wars, I went home at last. I fancied myself a leader, for had not the men of my battery given me a special token of appreciation? My talent for leadership, I imagined, would place me at the head of vast enterprises which I would manage with the utmost assurance.

### My early career as a stock market investor (PLBB)

**Bill (read by Joe)**: I took a night law course, and obtained employment as investigator for a surety company. The drive for success was on. I'd prove to the world I was important. 

<i>
**Charlie**: I already identify with Bill Wilson. It seems to be the main characteristics behind every alcoholic I've ever known.
</i>

<p class="text-muted">
**Bill (read by Charlie)**: The drive for success was on. I'd prove to the world I was important. 
</p>

<i>
**Charlie**: That seems to be the great driving force behind each one of us.
</i>

**Bill (read by Joe)**: My work took me about Wall Street and little by little I became interested in the market. Many people lost money--but some became very rich. Why not I? I studied economics and business as well as law. Potential alcoholic that I was, I nearly failed my law course. At one of the finals I was too drunk to think or write. Though my drinking was not yet continuous, it disturbed my wife. 

<i>
**Joe**: I can identify with Bill
</i>

**Bill (read by Joe)**: We had long talks when I would still her forebodings by telling her that men of genius conceived their best projects when drunk; that the most majestic constructions of philosophic thought were so derived.

<i>
**Charlie**: I have no trouble identifying with Bill Wilson.
</i>

<i>
**Joe**: Charlie said last night, we make our livings selling fast things talking to slow thinking people, Bill's trying to do some of that here, but we all know that Lois didn't buy that.
</i>

**Bill (read by Charlie)**: By the time I had completed the course, I knew the law was not for me. The inviting maelstrom of Wall Street had me in its grip. Business and financial leaders were my heroes. Out of this ally of drink and speculation, I commenced to forge the weapon that one day would turn in its flight like a boomerang and all but cut me to ribbons. Living modestly, my wife and I saved $1,000. It went into certain securities, then cheap and rather unpopular. I rightly imagined that they would some day have a great rise. I failed to persuade my broker friends to send me out looking over factories and managements, but my wife and I decided to go anyway. I had developed a theory that most people lost money in stocks through ignorance of markets. I discovered many more reasons later on.

<i>
**Charlie**: Now Bill is refering to a time back in the 1920s when the stock market was on a roll, just about everybody that delt with stocks was making money. All you had to do was buy them and hold onto them, let them go up in price, sell them, take your profits, buy some more. Everything was done on about a 10% margin. Everything was pure speculation. Bill became one of the first investment counselors on wall street. He bagan to say: "Look, sooner or later this bubble is going to burst. Sooner or later we are going to have to start making our decisions based on fact, rather than speculation." He went to the people who had the money, and he said "I don't have the money to do this, but if you guys could back me financially, I'll leave New York city and I'll start visiting these companies. and I'll look at the plants, and talk to the employees, and examine the books wherever I can, and I'll write up reports and send them back in here.  and we'll start making our decisions on whether to byu or not based on fact." And they said "No, Bill we dont need that sort of information. about all the money we want to make any-how." And you know how we alcoholics are, if we get a good idea, stuborn as hell, we're going to carry it out one way or the other. He said "The Hell with them, I don't need them any-how. I'll just go do this on my own."
</i>

**Bill (read by Charlie)**: We gave up our positions and off we roared on a motorcycle, the sidecar stuffed with tent, blankets, a change of clothes, and three huge volumes of a financial reference service. Our friends thought a lunacy commission should be appointed. Perhaps they were right. I had had some success at speculation, so we had a little money, but we once worked on a farm for a month to avoid drawing on our small capital. That was the last honest manual labor on my part for many a day. We covered the whole eastern United States in a year. At the end of it, my reports to Wall Street procured me a position there and the use of a large expense account. The exercise of an option brought in more money, leaving us with a profit of several thousand dollars for that year.

<i>
**Charlie**: Bill and Lois, traveling on a motorcycle, living in the tent, went up and down the eastern seaboard of the United States, and he wrote up reports on approximately 100 of the largest companies in the eastern states, sent them into New York city. The guys that had the money saw them, and said, "This is great information." Immediately they put Bill on the payroll, gave him a large expense account. He exercised an option, made a good profit, for the first time in his life, he's got something. He came from a town called East Dorset, Vermont. He had never had anything before in his life. Here's how he feels.
</i>

### Wealth, success, and lots of liquor (PLBB)

**Bill (read by Charlie)**: For the next few years fortune threw money and applause my way. I had arrived. 

<i>
**Charlie**: God how many of us feel like Bill does?
</i>

**Bill (read by Charlie)**: My judgment and ideas were followed by many to the tune of paper millions. The great boom of the late twenties was seething and swelling. Drink was taking an important and exhilarating part in my life. There was loud talk in the jazz places uptown. Everyone spent in thousands and chattered in millions. Scoffers could scoff and be damned. I made a host of fair-weather friends.

<i>
**Charlie**: And here is Bill back in New York city on top of the heap. He's making money for himself and a lot of other people, He's drinking also. But drinking is not a problem right now, it's a very exciting thing, and Bill is really really becoming a success, which is what he wanted to be. He also knows that if he's an alcoholic, then his drinking is going to get worse, because it is a progressive thing. Let's see where he goes from the top of the heap.
</i>

#### Delirium tremens aside (PLBB)

**Bill (read by Joe)**: My drinking assumed more serious proportions, continuing all day and almost every night. The remonstrances of my friends terminated in a row and I became a lone wolf. 

<i>
**Charlie**: How many of us have done the same thing? People began to say
</i>

<i>
**Nagging people**: Bill, you're drinking too much. Bill, you're costing us money. Bill, why don't you cut back. Bill, why don't you quit.
</i>

<i>
**Charlie**: And once again, rather than even consider that, he said "The Hell with them. I don't need them." He begins to operate on his own now. I have no problem identifying with Bill Wilson.
</i>

**Bill (read by Joe)**: There were many unhappy scenes in our sumptuous apartment. There had been no real infidelity, for loyalty to my wife, helped at times by extreme drunkenness, kept me out to those scrapes.

<i>
**Joe**: I've always believed in everything Bill wrote, but I'm not sure about that. You see we have a book in A.A. called "As Bill Sees It" and in Al-Anon, they have a book called "As Lois Remembers" a whole lot different.
</i>

<i>
**Charlie**: They're not exactly the same either. Let's go over to page 4. First paragraph.
</i>

### Golf fever (AR)

<i>
***[Skip to abruptly](#Abruptly)***
</i>

<p class="text-muted">In 1929 I contracted golf fever. We went at once to the country, my wife to applaud while I started out to overtake Walter Hagen. Liquor caught up with me much faster than I came up behind Walter. I began to be jittery in the morning. Golf permitted drinking every day and every night. It was fun to carom around the exclusive course which had inspired such awe in me as a lad. I acquired the impeccable coat of tan one sees upon the well-to-do. The local banker watched me whirl fat checks in and out of his till with amused skepticism.</p>

<p class="clearfix"></p>
<a id="Abruptly" class="text-muted">#Abruptly</a>

### Stock market close (AR)

<i>
**Joe**: Now here's old Bill. He's making lots of money, doing well. He's got lots of willpower lots of hope for the future--hard working, optimistic, a self made man. It says
</i>

**Bill (read by Joe)**: Abruptly in October 1929 hell broke loose on the New York stock exchange. After one of those days of inferno, I wobbled from a hotel bar to a brokerage office. It was eight o'clock--five hours after the market closed. The ticker still clattered. I was staring at an inch of the tape which bore the inscription XYZ-32. It had been 52 that morning. I was finished and so were many friends. The papers reported men jumping to death from the towers of High Finance. That disgusted me. I would not jump. I went back to the bar. My friends had dropped several million since ten o'clock--so what? Tomorrow was another day. As I drank, the old fierce determination to win came back.

<i>
**Charlie**: How many of us have done the same thing? Have come out of the jailhouse, or the divorce court, the hospital, or whatever--low, sad, depressed--hop off in the bar, have a couple of drinks, and as the alcohol courses through our veins, we say, "We'll show them! By God, they're not going to treat us that way." And we're off and we're running again, that old fierce determination to be somebody--to show them.
</i>

### A new start in Canada (PLBB)

**Bill (read by Charlie)**: Next morning I telephoned a friend in Montreal. He had plenty of money left and thought I had better go to Canada. 

**Charlie**: Bill was a drunk we wasn't stupid. He knew where the money was, so he went to Canada.

**Bill (read by Charlie)**: By the following spring we were living in our accustomed style. I felt like Napoleon returning from Elba. No St. Helena for me! But drinking caught up with me again and my generous friend had to let me go. This time we stayed broke.

**Charlie**: Now we see our drinking progressing to the point where we can no longer even hold a job.

**Bill (read by Charlie)**: We went to live with my wife's parents. I found a job; then lost it as the result of a brawl with a taxi driver. Mercifully, no one could guess that I was to have no real employment for five years, or hardly draw a sober breath. My wife began to work in a department store, coming home exhausted to find me drunk. I became an unwelcome hanger-on at brokerage places.

**Charlie**: Where he used to be the fair-haired boy. Where he use to make lots of money for lots of people. He goes in there now and they're saying. "Bill, we'd rather you didn't come in here today. You're about half-drunk, and you don't look good, and you're smelling bad. You're embarassing us in front of our customers. Please move right on down the street." Certainly, certainly, we can see the progression of alcoholism. We've gone from excitement, to now then we've gone to the point where it controls us completely. No longer hold a job, nobody wants us around anymore.

**Joe**: It starts to get worse.

**Bill (read by Joe)**: <span class="bg-warning">Liquor ceased to be a luxury; it became a necessity.</span>

**Charlie**: Now we're drinking for an entirely different reason. We're drinking now because we absolutely have to drink in order to live. No fun left anymore, no excitement, drinking in order to be able to live.

**Bill (read by Joe)**: "Bathtub" gin, two bottles a day, and often three, got to be routine. Sometimes a small deal would net a few hundred dollars, and I would pay my bills at the bars and delicatessens. This went on endlessly, and I began to waken very early in the morning shaking violently. A tumbler full of gin followed by half a dozen bottles of beer would be required if I were to eat any breakfast. <span class="bg-warning">Nevertheless, I still thought I could control the situation,</span>

<p class="text-muted">
and there were periods of sobriety which renewed my wife's hope.
</p>

<i>
**Charlie**: Remember last night when we saw that Dr. Silkworth said that
</i>

<i>
**Dr. Silkworth (paraphrased by Charlie)**: we cannot after a time differentiate the true from the false.
</i>

<i>
**Charlie**: To us, what we're doing is normal. We see Bill's life going to hell in a hand basket already. Bill can't see that. He thinks he can still control the situation. Let's see where he goes on control.
</i>

<i>
**Joe**: Things are real bad in Bill's life, but it says
</i>

**Bill (read by Joe)**: Gradually things got worse. The house was taken over by the mortgage holder, my mother-in-law died, my wife and father-in-law became ill.

**Bill (read by Joe)**: Then I got a promising business opportunity. Stocks were at the low point of 1932, and I had somehow formed a group to buy. I was to share generously in the profits. Then I went on a prodigious bender, and that chance vanished.

<i>
**Charlie**: This is a story within itself. The people who had the money knew how good Bill was at putting these deals together. They came to Bill and they said
</i>

<i>
**Money people**: Bill, we've got a proposition for you. We've got an opportunity to not only make money for us, but make money for you. And if you can stay sober, then we'd like for you to handle this thing.
</i>

<i>
**Charlie**: And Bill said
</i>

<i>
**Bill (paraphrased by Charlie)**: Don't you worry about that drinking. I'm through with drinking. You'll not have to worry about that.
</i>

<i>
**Charlie**: And he worked for a matter of months putting this deal together. And a few days before it was to be successfully completed. One night, they're all sitting around in a hotel room talking about this. Somebody passes around the bottle of Apple Jack. This was back in the days of prohibition. It came to Bill, and he said
</i>

<i>
**Bill (paraphrased by Charlie)**: No, thank you. I'm not drinking anymore.
</i>

<i>
**Charlie**: After awhile it came back to him and the guy next to him said
</i>

<i>
**Money people (paraphrased by Charlie)**: Bill, you don't understand what this is. This is the finest Apple Jack in the world. It is called Jersey Lightning. You better have a drink.
</i>

<i>
**Bill (paraphrased by Charlie)**: Hmm, I've never tasted any Jersey Lightning.
</i>

<i>
**Charlie**: No more thought than that, and he reached out, grabbed the bottle, took a drink, triggered the allergy, couldn't sober up, blew the whole deal. The importance in it lies within the next statement.
</i>

**Bill (read by Joe)**: I woke up. This had to be stopped. I saw I could not take so much as one drink. I was through forever. Before then, I had written lots of sweet promises, but my wife happily observed that this time I meant business. And so I did.

<i>
**Charlie**: For the first time, Bill could differentiate the true from the false. For the first time he could truely see what alcohol was doing to him. And he did this like all the rest of us, he trotted out his willpower. He said, "Sick them, will. We're through with that drinking, we'll never drink again as long as we live."
</i>

<i>
**Charlie**: They try and tell us that we are weak willed people. Don't you believe that. We are strong willed people. Weak willed people do not become alcoholics. Third time they vomit they quit drinking. Alcoholic knows there's gotta be some way to drink without puking we damn near kill ourselves. We got lots of willpower.
</i>

<i>
**Joe**: Bill doesn't know what we learned last night. Any time there's a battle going on between the willpower and the obsession of the mind, the obsession of the mind is stronger than the willpower, it'll always win. That's how strong it is.
</i>

<i>
**Charlie**: Let's see what happened to him on willpower.
</i>

**Bill (read by Joe)**: Shortly afterward I came home drunk. There had been no fight. Where had been my high resolve? I simply didn't know. It hadn't even come to mind. Someone had pushed a drink my way, and I had taken it. Was I crazy? I began to wonder, for such an appalling lack of perspective seemed near being just that.

### Stopping and starting again (PLBB)

**Bill (read by Joe)**: Renewing my resolve, I tried again. Some time passed, and confidence began to be replaced by cocksureness. I could laugh at the gin mills. Now I had what it takes! One day I walked into a cafe to telephone. In no time I was beating on the bar asking myself how it happened. As the whisky rose to my head I told myself I would manage better next time, but I might as well get good and drunk then. And I did.

**Bill (read by Joe)**: The remorse, horror and hopelessness of the next morning are unforgettable. The courage to do battle was not there. My brain raced uncontrollably and there was a terrible sense of impending calamity. I hardly dared cross the street, lest I collapse and be run down by an early morning truck, for it was scarcely daylight. An all night place supplied me with a dozen glasses of ale. My writhing nerves were stilled at last. A morning paper told me the market had gone to hell again. Well, so had I . The market would recover, but I wouldn't. That was a hard thought. Should I kill myself? No--not now. Then a mental fog settled down. Gin would fix that. So two bottles, and--oblivion.

<i>
**Joe**: You see, Bill questioned, used his willpower, and that didn't work. He began to question his sanity, and that didn't work. And then he began to contemplate suicide. And then he was drinking for the sickest effect of all, total oblivion. And that's where we find Bill at this time.
</i>

**Bill (read by Joe)**: The mind and body are marvelous mechanisms, for mine endured this agony two more years. Sometimes I stole from my wife's slender purse when the morning terror and madness were on me. Again I swayed dizzily before an open window, or the medicine cabinet where there was poison, cursing myself for a weakling. There were flights from city to country and back, as my wife and I sought escape. Then came the night when the physical and mental torture was so hellish I feared I would burst through my window, sash and all. Somehow I managed to drag my mattress to a lower floor, lest I suddenly leap. A doctor came with a heavy sedative. next day found me drinking both gin and sedative. This combination soon landed me on the rocks. People feared for my sanity. So did I. I could eat little or nothing when drinking, and I was forty pounds under weight.

<i>
**Joe**: So now we find Bill drinking for oblivion. Not eating very often. I can identify with Bill. He's dying of malnutrition. I can identify with Bill, because when I was drinking those last years of my drinking, occasionally I would eat a Bologna sandwich, because I knew you were supposed to eat something, rather than just drink. And that's why Bill was doing it this time. Dying of malnutrition.
</i>

### Learning about alcoholism at the hospital (PLBB)

**Bill (read by Charlie)**: My brother-in-law is a physician, and through his kindness and that of my mother I was placed in a nationally-known hospital for the mental and physical rehabilitation of alcoholics. 

<i>
**Charlie**: This is the Towns hospital, and this is the summer of 1933.
</i>

**Bill (read by Charlie)**: Under the so-called bella-donna treatment my brain cleared. 

<i>
**Charlie**: Bella-donna was a drug they used to fool the body into thinking that it had alcohol in it. And it was used for withdrawl purposes. It's what they use Valium for today.
</i>

**Bill (read by Charlie)**: Hydrotherapy and mild exercise helped much. 

<i>
**Charlie**: Hydrotherapy is water treatment. We saw some of that in the treatment center up in Australia back in the 1980s. They would put the alcoholic on a gurney, roll them into the shower room, and they had shower heads all the way around the shower room, alternating hot and cold water. You'd be in there for about 30 minutes. It doesn't cure alcoholism, but it makes a clean drunk out of you I'll guarantee you that. Those guys who come out of there, their skin all wrinkled up and shriveled up.
</i>

**Bill (read by Charlie)**: Best of all, I met a kind doctor who explained that though certainly selfish and foolish, I had been seriously ill, bodily and mentally.

<i>
**Charlie**: Silky sat down with him and explained his ideas about the physical allergy and the obsession of the mind. And here's the effect it had on Bill.
</i>

**Bill (read by Charlie)**: It relieved me somewhat to learn that in alcoholics the will is amazingly weakened when it comes to combating liquor, though if often remains strong in other respects. My incredible behavior in the face of a desperate desire to stop was explained. Understanding myself now, I fared forth in high hope. For three or four months the goose hung high. I went to town regularly and even made a little money. Surely this was the answer--self-knowledge.

<i>
**Charlie**: For the first time, Bill understood his problem. He knew it was not will-power, he knew it wasn't moral character and sin, he knew it was a physical allergy, coupled with the obsession of the mind. And that's what made him absolutely powerless. He said
</i>

<i>
**Bill (paraphrased by Charlie)**: Now that I know what's wrong with me, I'll not have to drink any longer.
</i>

<i>
**Charlie**: Let's see where he goes from here.
</i>

<i>
**Joe**: The information that we learned last night about the Doctor's Opinion and the illness of alcoholism is very, very important information. But it's just information, it will not solve alcoholism. Just because we know what the problem is, as Bill found out, 
</i>

**Bill (read by Joe)**: But it was not, for the frightful day came when I drank once more. The curve of my declining moral and bodily health fell off like a ski-jump. After a time I returned to the hospital. 


<i>
**Charlie**: Now, this is the summer of 1934. A year later we go back into the Towns the second time.
</i>

**Bill (read by Joe)**: This was the finish, the curtain, it seemed to me. My weary and despairing wife was informed that it would all end with heart failure during delirium tremens, or I would develop a wet brain, perhaps within a year. We would soon have to give me over to the undertaker of the asylum.

<i>
**Joe**: Bill was laying there in the hospital room all sick. He overheard Lois and Dr. Silkworth talking and she said
</i>

<i>
**Lois (paraphrased by Joe)**: Dr. Silkworth, is there any hope for him?
</i>

<i>
**Dr. Silkworth (paraphrased by Joe)**: No, I don't believe so, Lois. We'll have to give him over to the undertaker of the asyllum, because there's no solution for Bill.
</i>

**Bill (read by Joe)**: They did not need to tell me. I knew, and almost welcomed the idea. It was a devastating blow to my pride. I, who had thought so well of myself and my abilities, of my capacity to surmount obstacles, was cornered at last. Now I was to plunge into the dark, joining that endless procession of sots who had gone on before. I thought of my poor wife. There had been much happiness after all. What would I not give to make amends. But that was over now.

<i>
**Joe**: Bill was a very hard working optimistic individual, and now we see Bill, he's hopeless. He is without hope. And we all know you can't live long without hope. You gotta have hope. But Bill is hope-less at the moment.
</i>

<i>
**Charlie**: Let's look at this next statement very carefully.
</i>

**Bill (read by Charlie)**: <span class="bg-warning">No words can tell of the loneliness and despair I found in that bitter morass of self-pity. Quicksand stretched around me in all directions. I had met my match. I had been overwhelmed. Alcohol was my master.</span>

<i>
**Charlie**: I've never seen a better description of step 1. There was no step 1 written in those days, but this is surely where Bill took it. He admitted complete defeat. Alcohol had whipped him in a fair fight. He was completely powerless over alcohol. Now if that should happen to you and I today, chances are we would say "Well, that being the case, I guess I better go to A.A." But Bill didn't have any A.A. to go to. He's in the best facility that he knows of. So even though he's admitted his powerlessness. Even though he's taken what we know as step 1. The only thing that he can do is leave that hospital, and try to stay sober on his own.
</i>

**Bill (read by Charlie)**: Trembling, I stepped from the hospital a broken man. Fear sobered me for a bit. Then came the insidious insanity of that first drink, and on Armistice Day 1934, I was off again. Everyone became resigned to the certainty that I would have to be shut up somewhere, or would stumble along to a miserable end. <span class="bg-promise">How dark it is before the dawn!</span> 

<hr/>

**Bill (read by Charlie)**: <span class="bg-promise">In reality that was the beginning of my last debauch. I was soon to be catapulted into what I like to call the fourth dimension of existence. I was to know happiness, peace, and usefulness, in a way of life that is incredibly more wonderful as time passes.</span>

### A visit from a friend (PLBB)

**Bill (read by Charlie)**: Near the end of that bleak November, I sat drinking in my kitchen. 

<i>
**Charlie**: And I can imagine it was a pretty bleak November. He started drinking on November 11th, triggered the allergy, he couldn't stop, been drunk now for about 3 weeks.
</i>

**Bill (read by Charlie)**: With a certain satisfaction I reflected there was enough gin concealed about the house to carry me through that night and the next day. My wife was at work. I wondered whether I dared hide a full bottle of gin near the head of our bed. I would need it before daylight.

**Bill (read by Charlie)**: My musing was interrupted by the telephone. The cheery voice of an old school friend asked if he might come over. 

<i>
**Charlie**: Now this was Ebby Thatcher. Bill and Ebby had gone to school together when they were younger. Did lots of drinking together. And Bill knew about Ebby, and he knew how Ebby drank. He said
</i>

**Bill (read by Charlie)**: <span class="bg-promise">*He was sober*.</span>

<i>
**Charlie**: If you'll notice that's in Squiggley writing. Squiggley writing in the Big Book is very important. It really amazed Bill. Ebby is sober.
</i>

**Bill (read by Charlie)**: It was years since I could remember his coming to New York in that condition. I was amazed. Rumor had it that he had been committed for alcoholic insanity. 

<i>
**Charlie**: The last Bill heard about Ebby is Ebby was going to be committed to the [state insane asylum in the State of Vermont for alcoholic insanity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vermont_State_Hospital). That's what they used to do with people like us. Before we had the treatment centers. They'd haul us in front of a judge. The judge would commit us to the state insane asylum for alcoholic insanity for an undetermined period of time.
</i>

<i>
**Joe**: Until you got well.
</i>

<i>
**Charlie**:  You were stuck there until you got well. And that's the last he heard about Ebby.
</i>

**Bill (read by Joe)**: I wondered how he had escaped. 

<i>
**Joe**: He was amazed that Ebby was out of this treatment center, or insane asylum, excuse me. Same thing.
</i>

<i>
**Charlie**: Same thing. They've renamed everything, you know, these days.
</i>

<i>
**Joe**: Talk about dysfunctional families, well mine was just crazy. But Ebby comes from a very prominent family up in Albany, NY. In fact his father was the Mayor of Albany. Very prominent family, and Ebby's drinking was embarassing the family. So they called Ebby and one day and say, "Ebby you're embarassing the family with you're drinking, we would like for you to just, basically, get out of town, and stay at the old summer place, and we'll be over there this summer. And while you're there you might as well sober up, and if you get sober, you might as well make yourself useful and paint up, fix up the old summer place, because we'll be using it."
</i>

<i>
**Joe**: So Ebby went out and went over to Vermont. He began to fix up the old summer place. Painting and fixing, and one day he finished painting this wall, and he looked at it and we was admiring that. He noticed some pidgins were doing some things on the side of his wall that he didn't like. So he went in the house and got his shotgun out. And began to shoot at the pidgins, blowing holes in the side of the wall. The neighbors don't like that at all, so they call the police, and have him arrested, and they took him before the judge, and they were going to commit him for alcoholic insanity. But Ebby got real lucky. Two fellows interceded on his behalf. One guy's name was Rowland Hazard, and the other was Cebra Graves. And they asked the judge if they might release Ebby to their care, because they were going to the Oxford group, and they felt that if they took Ebby to the Oxford group meetings, and he would apply tenents of the Oxford group, as they have, then maybe he too would stay sober, as they have. Well Ebby began to go to the Oxford group meetings, and he began to stay sober. A couple of months later he goes to New York, the cavelry mission, the headquarters of the Oxford group at that time, and he began to stay there in that mission and after awhile he remembered his friend Bill. He said, "I think I'll go over and talk to Bill, maybe I could help Bill stay sober, as these two fellows have helped me."
</i>

<i>
**Charlie**: Now, Bill didn't know any of this stuff. He said
</i>

<p class="text-muted">
**Bill (read by Charlie)**: I wondered how he had escaped. 
</p>

**Bill (read by Charlie)**: Of course he would have dinner, and then I could drink openly with him. Unmindful of his welfare, I thought only of recapturing the spirit of other days. There was that time we had chartered an airplane to complete a jag! His coming was an oasis in this dreary desert of futility. The very thing--an oasis! Drinkers are like that.

**Bill (read by Charlie)**: The door opened and he stood there, fresh-skinned and glowing. There was something about his eyes. He was inexplicably different. What had happened?

**Bill (read by Charlie)**: I pushed a drink across the table. He refused it. Disappointed but curious, I wondered what had got into the fellow. He wasn't himself.

**Bill (read by Charlie)**: "Come, what's all this about? I queried.

**Bill (read by Charlie)**: He looked straight at me. Simply, but smilingly, he said, 

**Ebby (read by Charlie)**: "I've got religion."

<i>
**Charlie**: I'm glad that didn't happen in my kitchen. I have no idea what I would have done. But here's what Bill did, he said
</i>

**Bill (read by Charlie)**: I was aghast. So that was it--last summer an alcoholic crackpot; now, I suspected, a little cracked about religion. He had that starry-eyed look. Yes, the old boy was on fire all right. But bless his heart, let him rant! Besides, my gin would last longer than his preaching.

**Bill (read by Charlie)**: But he did no ranting. In a matter of fact way he told how two men had appeared in court, persuading the judge to suspend his commitment. They had told of a simple religious idea 

<i>
**Joe**: Which is step 2
</i>

**Bill (read by Charlie)**: and a practical program of action. 

<i>
**Joe**: Which is steps 3 through 12
</i>

**Bill (read by Charlie)**: <span class="bg-promise">That was two months ago and the result was self-evident. It worked!</span>

<i>
**Charlie**: So now, Bill knows three things. He got the problem from Dr. Silkworth. He got the solution here referred to as a simple religious idea from Ebby. He got the practical program of action from Ebby. So now he knows all three things. But Bill is also just like so many of us. He did not like this simple religious idea. Bill's thoughts and his ideas about God and about religion, etc. Were enough that it made him resent what Ebby had brought to him. 
</i>

**Bill (read by Charlie)**: He had come to pass his experience along to me--if I cared to have it. I was shocked, but interested. Certainly I was interested. I had to be, for I was hopeless.

**Bill (read by Charlie)**: He talked for hours. Childhood memories rose before me. I could almost hear the sound of the preacher's voice as I sat, on still Sundays, way over there on the hillside; there was that proffered temperance pledge I never signed; my grandfather's good natured contempt of some church fold and their doings; his insistence that the spheres really had their music; but his denial of the preacher's right to tell him how he must listen; 

<i>
**Charlie**: You know, Bill's grandfather Grandpa Griffith raised him from 12 years on. Grandpa Griffith believed in some power greater than human power, but he would let anybody tell him how he had to believe in it. His grandpa had a great problem with the world's religions. He passed that along to Bill. 
</i>

**Bill (read by Charlie)**: his fearlessness as he spoke of these things just before he died; these recollections welled up from the past. They made me swallow hard.

#### Atheist aside (PLBB)

**Bill (read by Charlie)**: That war-time day in old Winchester Cathedral came back again.

<i>
**Charlie**: Where Bill is having a problem now with this religious idea that Ebby is talking about. We've seen him take step 1. In the next couple of pages, we're going to see him take step 2. Let's see how he came to be able to accept this religious idea.
</i>

<i>
**Joe**: He's already taken step 1, so now he's betwen steps 1 and 2. He hasn't taken step 2 yet. He began to ponder these things.
</i>

**Bill (read by Joe)**: I had always believed in a Power greater that myself. I had often pondered these things. I was not an atheist. Few people really are, for that means blind faith in the strange proposition that this universe originated in a cipher and aimlessly rushes nowhere. My intellectual heroes, the chemists, the astronomers, even the evolutionists, suggested vast laws and forces at work. Despite contrary indications, I had little doubt that a might purpose and rhythm underlay all. How could there be so much of precise and immutable law, and no intelligence? I simply had to believe in a Spirit of the Universe, who knew neither time nor limitation. But that was as far as I had gone.

<i>
**Charlie**: Here's where I really begin to identify with Bill Wilson.
</i>

**Bill (read by Joe)**: With ministers, and the world's religions, I parted right there. When they talked of a God personal to me, who was love, superhuman strength and direction, I became irritated and my mind snapped shut against such a theory.

**Bill (read by Joe)**: To Christ I conceded the certainty of a great man, not too closely followed by those who claimed Him. His moral teaching--most excellent. For myself, I had adopted those parts which seemed convenient and not too difficult; the rest I disregarded.

<i>
**Charlie**: Anybody in here identify with Bill Wilson? You betcha! We can see that Bill is having a terrible time with this religious idea. Now let's go down the the middle paragraph.
</i>

<p class="text-muted">
The wars which had been fought, the burnings and chicanery that religious dispute had facilitated, made me sick. I honestly doubted whether, on balance, the religions of mankind had done any good. Judging from what I had seen in Europe and since, the power of God in human affairs was negligible, the Brotherhood of Man a grim jest. If there was a Devil, he seemed the Boss Universal, and he certainly had me.
</p>

**Bill (read by Charlie)**: <span class="bg-promise">But my friend sat before me, and he made the point-blank declaration that God had done for him what he could not do for himself.</span> <span class="bg-warning">His human will had failed. Doctors had pronounced him incurable. Society was about to lock him up.</span> <span class="bg-direction">Like myself, he had admitted complete defeat.</span> <span class="bg-promise">Then he had, in effect, been raised from the dead, suddenly taken from the scrap heap to a level of life better than the best he had ever known!</span>

**Bill (read by Charlie)**: Had this power originated in him? Obviously it had not. There had been no more power in him than there was in me at that minute; and this was none at all.

<i>
**Charlie**: <span class="bg-direction">This is why the identification process is so important.</span> Bill knew about Ebby. He knew how Ebby drank, and he knew that if Ebby had been sober 2 months, then some power greater than Ebby had to be working in Ebby's life, whether Bill likes it or not is absolutely besides the point. Ebby is living proof of it. That's what you and I offer to the newcomer. We sit there talking to the newcomer. We're living proof that some power greater than human power is working in our lives also. Whether the newcomer likes it or not is besides the point. We are the living proof of it. Ebby was the proof for Bill. Now, I would have like to have been there that day. Sitting in a corner, watching them. Bill is about 2/3rds drunk. Ebby has come out of the Oxford groups and they were a group of people practicing first century Christianity to the best of their abilities. The terms they used were highly religious in nature. Ebby is on fire, and he's talking about God. And Bill don't like it at all. And they're sitting there arguing with each other about who God is, and what he is, and Bill said "Don't give me that religious crap. Oh, yeah, I believe in the great mind or spirit of nature. But don't give me that other kind of stuff. And Ebby is trying to put it on old Bill, and they're arguing back and forth, back and forth, back and forth. Let's go over to page 12.
</i>

### Human heart (AR)

<div class="text-muted">
That floored me. It began to look as though religious people were right after all. Here was something at work in a human heart which had done the impossible. My ideas about miracles were drastically revised right then. Never mind the musty past; here sat a miracle directly across the kitchen table. He shouted great tidings.

I saw that my friend was much more than inwardly reorganized. He was on different footing. His roots grasped anew soil.
</div>

### Old prejudice (AR)

**Bill (read by Joe)**: Despite the living example of my friend there remained in me the vestiges of my old prejudice. 

<i>
**Charlie**: Bill still doesn't like this idea.
</i>

**Bill (read by Joe)**: The word God still aroused a certain antipathy. When the thought was expressed that there might be a God personal to me this feeling was intensified. I didn't like the idea. I could go for such conceptions as Creative Intelligence, Universal Mind or Spirit of Nature but I resisted the thought of a Czar of the Heavens, however loving His sway might be. I have since talked with scores of men who felt the same way.

<i>
**Joe**: In other words, Bill was saying, "There's got to be a harder way to do this. What you're saying is too simple."
</i>

<i>
**Charlie**: Now I guess Ebby finally got tired of this deal. Let's look at the next statement very carefully. If you'll notice it's in Squiggley writing
</i>

**Bill (read by Charlie)**: My friend suggested what then seemed a novel idea. He said, 

**Ebby (read by Charlie)**: <span class="bg-direction">*Why don't you choose your own conception of God*?</span>

<i>
**Charlie**: In other words, he said "Bill, what are we arguing about?" "What difference does it make what we call Him?" "Why don't you choose your own conception of God?" We're no longer dealing with religion now. We're dealing with spirituality. You see religion says, "this is the way you have to believe." Spirituality says, "It really doesn't make any difference what you believe." The only question is "Are you willing to believe?" So we're through with religion now we're talking about spirituality. And here is the effect that it had on Bill.
</i>

**Bill (read by Charlie)**: That statement hit me hard. It melted the icy intellectual mountain in whose shadow I had lived and shivered many years. I stood in the sunlight at last.

<i>
**Charlie**: It took arguments away from him. He couldn't argue with that statement.
</i>

**Bill (read by Charlie)**: <span class="bg-direction">*It was only a matter of being willing to believe in a Power greater than myself. Nothing more was required of me to make my beginning*.</span> I saw that growth could start from that point. Upon a foundation of complete willingness I might build what I saw in my friend. Would I have it? Of course I would!

<i>
**Charlie**: Surely this is where Bill took step 2. No step 2 written in those days. But here is where he came to believe in a power greater than himself. Based on Ebby's simple little statement.
</i>

**Ebby (read by Charlie)**: <span class="text-muted">*Why don't you choose your own conception of God*?</span>

<i>
**Charlie**: And that statement has opened the door for countless millions of us alcoholics who were having trouble with religion. And I think the reason it really works is we're allowed here to have our own conception of God. And you know as I look back at my lifetime, I realize that I've never had any problem with my own conception of anything. You betcha! Let me believe the way I want to and I'm ready to go now. Bill has now taken step 2, isn't that something. When he made that statement.
</i>

**Bill (read by Charlie)**: <span class="text-muted">I saw that growth could start from that point. Upon a foundation of complete willingness I might build what I saw in my friend. Would I have it? Of course I would!</span>


<i>
**Charlie**: This is Bill's first reference to a wonderfuly effective spiritual structure, and he's going to start painting a picture in our mind using words. Eventually he'll tell us what the structure is, and show us where we pass through it to freedom. Now his first reference to it is 
</i>

**Bill (read by Charlie)**: <span class="text-muted">Upon a foundation of complete willingness I might build what I saw in my friend.</span>

<i>
**Charlie**: The foundation of this structure is willingness. That came from step 1. When we could see that what we were doing would no longer work period. We began to be willing to change. Later on we're going to see where believing step 2 is the cornerstone of that structure, and eventually he'll tell us exactly what it is. A beautiful way to teach. Painting pictures in our mind using words. If we are willing, and if we believe, then we've already started the road to recovery. Bill has now taken steps 1 and 2. Immediately, Ebby starts taking him to Oxford group meetings. But remember, Bill is still drinking, triggered the allergy on November 11th, he can't stop. On about December 10th, probably, 1934 Bill was put back in the hospital for the third time for withdrawl from alcohol by Dr. Silkworth. Ebby comes to visit with him. They begin to apply the Oxford group program of action. And Bill has his spiritual experience. Let's look on page 13. See if we can't see the last 10 steps of Alcoholics Anonymous. He's taken 1 and 2. Let's see if we acn't see the last 10.
</i>

<div class="text-muted">
Thus was I convinced that God is concerned with us humans when we want Him enough. At long last I saw, I felt, I believed. Scales of pride and prejudice fell from my eyes. A new world came into view.

The real significance of my experience in the Cathedral burst upon me. For a brief moment, I had needed and wanted God. There had been a humble willingness to have Him with me--and He came. But soon the sense of His presence had been blotted out by worldly clamors, mostly those within myself. And so it had been ever since. How blind I had been.
</div>

### The long road to recovery (PLBB)

**Bill (read by Joe)**: At the hospital I was separated from alcohol for the last time. Treatment seemed wise, for I showed signs of delirium tremens.

**Bill (read by Joe)**: <span class="bg-direction">There I humbly offered myself to God, as I then I understood Him, to do with me as He would. I placed myself unreservedly under His care and direction. I admitted for the first time that of myself I was nothing; that without Him I was lost.</span>

<i>
**Charlie**: The first tenent that the Oxford group had was surrender. Now Bill later on when he wrote the steps, he realized that no alcoholic would like the word "surrender." So he changed their first tenent into our third step, where we made a decision to turn our will over to the care of God as we understand Him. We see him there taking the first tenent which turned out to be our step 3. He's now taken 1, 2, and 3.
</i>

**Bill (read by Joe)**: <span class="bg-direction">I ruthlessly faced my sins</span>

**Bill (read by Charlie)**: <span class="text-muted">I ruthlessly faced my sins</span>

<i>**Charlie**: They're second tenent was examine your sins, and Bill knew that no good alcoholic was going to do that. So he changed that into "Made a searching and fearless moral inventory of ourselves" He's taking step 4 there.</i>

**Bill (read by Joe)**: <span class="bg-direction">and became willing to have my new-found Friend take them away, root and branch. I have not had a drink since.</span>

**Bill (read by Charlie)**: <span class="text-muted">and became willing to have my new-found Friend take them away, root and branch.</span>

<i>**Charlie**: You'll notice that Friend is capitalized. This is one of the words that Bill uses for God. And that little statement</i>

**Bill (read by Charlie)**: <span class="text-muted">and became willing to have my new-found Friend take them away, root and branch.</span>

<i>**Charlie**: later became steps 6 and 7. We became willing to have God remove these things and humbly ask him to do so. There we're dealing with 6 and 7.</i>

**Bill (read by Joe)**: My schoolmate visited me, and <span class="bg-direction">I fully acquainted him with my problems and deficiencies.</span>

<i>**Charlie**: He's taking what we know today as step 5. They're in the Towns hospital, with Ebby.
</i>

**Bill (read by Joe)**: <span class="bg-direction">We made a list of people I had hurt or toward whom I felt resentment. I expressed my entire willingness to approach these individuals, admitting my wrong. Never was I to be critical of them. I was to right all such matters to the utmost of my ability.</span>

<i>**Charlie**: They had an Oxford group tenent called *restitution*. And Bill knew no self-respecting alcoholic is going to do restitution. So he took that and made 2 steps out of it. Step 8 and 9, where we made the list and became willing, and then made amends. There we're dealing with 8 and 9.</i>

**Bill (read by Joe)**: <span class="bg-direction">I was to test my thinking by the new God-consciousness within.</span> <span class="bg-promise">Common sense would thus become uncommon sense.</span>

<i>**Charlie**: That statement would later become step 10, where we continued to take personal inventory, and when we were wrong, promptly explained, I mean admitted it.
</i>

<i>**Joe**: That's the new step 10.
</i>

**Bill (read by Joe)**: <span class="bg-direction">I was to sit quietly when in doubt, asking only for direction and strength to meet my problems as He would have me. Never was I to pray for myself, except as my requests bore on my usefulness to others.</span> <span class="bg-promise">Then only might I expect to receive. But that would be in great measure.</span>

<i>**Charlie**: And there we see all the elements of step 11, where we sought through prayer and medication, I mean meditation, to improve out conscious contact with God, and so on and so forth. There's he's dealing with step 11.
</i>

**Bill (read by Joe)**: <span class="bg-direction">My friend promised when these things were done I would enter upon a new relationship with my Creator; that I would have the elements of a way of living which answered all my problems.</span>

<i>**Charlie**: That's gotta be the first part of step 12. Ebby had a spiritual awakening as a result of these steps. We see Bill in the Towns hospital applying the Oxford group tenents, which later he made into the last 10 steps of Alcoholics Anonymous. This is why in How it Works, "These are the steps we took" which are suggested as a program of recovery. Bill took them in the Towns hospital with the help of Ebby. Now let's see what happened to him.
</i>

**Bill (read by Joe)**: <span class="bg-direction">Belief in the power of God, plus enough willingness, honesty and humility to establish and maintain the new order of things, were the essential requirements.</span>

**Bill (read by Joe)**: Simple, but not easy; a price had to be paid. <span class="bg-direction">It meant destruction of self-centeredness. I must turn in all things to the Father of Light who presides over us all.</span>

<i>**Joe**: Poor little alcoholics need to give up the two most important things in our lives. The first thing is our alcohol, and the second thing is our self-centeredness. Two things.
</i>

<i>**Charlie**: Very difficult to do. Very difficult, but very simple.
</i>

**Bill (read by Joe)**: <span class="bg-promise">These were revolutionary and drastic proposals, but the moment I fully accepted them, the effect was electric. There was a sense of victory, followed by such a peace and serenity as I had never know. There was utter confidence. I felt lifted up, as though the great clean wind of a mountain top blew through and through.</span> God comes to most men gradually, but His impact on me was sudden and profound.

**Bill (read by Joe)**: For a moment I was alarmed, and called my friend, the doctor, to ask if I were still sane. He listened in wonder as I talked.

<i>**Joe**: Bill overheard Lois and Dr. Silkworth talking, so he thought he'd gone crazy. He thought he would check out with Dr. Silkworth to see if he had gone crazy.
</i>

**Bill (read by Joe)**: Finally he shook his head saying, 

**Dr. Silkworth (read by Joe)**: <span class="bg-direction">"Something has happened to you I don't understand. But you had better hang on to it. Anything is better than the way you were."</span> 

**Bill (read by Joe)**: The good doctor now sees many men who have such experiences. He knows that they are real.

<i>**Charlie**: Now, we don't know what happened to Bill that day, we were not there to see that. But we know this was probably about December 14th 1934. We do know that Bill didn't die until January of 1971. We do know that it was never necessary for him to take another drink, from this day until the day that he died. Something profound took place in his life on that day. Bill always said, I had a vital spiritual experience, as the result of these steps, during which old ideas were cast aside, and replaced with a new set of ideas, and I was able to live the rest of my life without drinking. Now here's a guy who went into the hospital. Selfish and self-centered to the extreme. Always doing what he wanted to do whenever he wanted to do it. That was his attitude when he went in there. Let's look at his attitude now that he's had the spiritual experience.
</i>

### Bringing a message of recovery to more alcoholics (PLBB)

**Bill (read by Joe)**: While I lay in the hospital the thought came that there were thousands of hopeless alcoholics who might be glad to have what had been so freely given me. Perhaps I could help some of them. They in turn might work with others.

<i>**Joe**: Bill had that gigantic spiritual experience and then he immediately began to think how he can give it other people. Something profound happened with Bill.
</i>

**Bill (read by Charlie)**: My friend had emphasized the absolute necessity of demonstrating these principles in all my affairs. Particularly was it imperative to work with others as he had worked with me. Faith without works was dead, he said. And how appallingly true for the alcoholic! For if an alcoholic failed to perfect and enlarge his spiritual life through work and self-sacrifice for others, he could not survive the certain trials and low spots ahead. If he did not work, he would surely drink again, and if he drank, he would surely die. Then faith would be dead indeed. With us it is just like that.

<i>
**Charlie**: Thank God Bill knew that, and accepted that fact, because when he was in Akron about to get drunk. He remembered back in New York city, even though he had never helped anybody else that he himself had felt better. That's why he got ahold of Dr. Bob. To try and help Dr. Bob, not necessarily to sober up Bob, but to keep Bill from getting drunk. And thank God it kept him from getting drunk, and Bob sobered up, and from there we have the fellowship of Alcoholics Anonymous. 
</i>

<p class="text-muted">
**Bill (read by Charlie)**: Faith without works was dead.
</p>

<i>
**Charlie**: You just about anybody I see drink today that has been in A.A. for any period of time, usually they have quit working with other people. And when they quit working with other people they start thinking about self only. And after awhile all of the old problems come back and we end up getting drunk all over again. Always working with others will help us, when nothing else will.
</i>

**Bill (read by Joe)**: My wife and I abandoned ourselves with enthusiasm to the idea of helping other alcoholics to a solution of their problems. It was fortunate, for my old business associates remained skeptical for a year and a half, during which I found little work. I was not too well at the time, and was plagued by waves of self-pity and resentment. This sometimes nearly drove me back to drink, but I soon found that when all other measures failed, work with another alcoholic would save the day. Many times I have gone to my old hospital in despair. On talking to a man there, I would be amazingly lifted up and set on my feet. It is a design for living that works in rough going.

<i>**Joe**: We took a design for living that works in rough going, and turned it into a non-drinking society, I'm afraid. It's a design for living and the work is really, really hard, but the pay is really, really good, too.
</i>

<i>**Charlie**: We managed to stay sober, isn't that something? Now if we're brand new alcoholics our here in California. No fellowship around us. The first contact we've had is this book called Alcoholics Anonymous. We've read the Doctor's Opinion. We've been able to see what our problem is. We've read Bill's Story. We've been able to identify with another alcoholic. We've seen him go from fun drinking, to drinking because of absolute necessity, going finally to the sickest of all complete oblivion. Then we've seen him recover from that condition. Now surely, surely we can say to ourselves, "We're not like this guy" That if he can recover, just maybe we could too. The beginning of belief--the beginning of hope. By now we can probably hardly wait to see what really did take place in Bill's life and how he recovered. And I don't think it's by accident that the very next chapter is titlted "There is a Solution". There is a solution to the thing that Bill has described in his own story. and to what Dr. Silkworth is talked to us about it. Now if our problem is powerless, which we should be convinced of that by now. Then obviously the answer is going to lie within power. 
</i>

<div class="text-muted">
We commenced to make many fast friends and a fellowship has grown up among us of which it is a wonderful thing to feel a part. The joy of living we really have, even under pressure and difficulty. I have seen hundreds of families set their feet in the path that really goes somewhere; have seen the most impossible domestic situations righted; feuds and bitterness of all sorts wiped out. I have seen men come out of asylums and resume a vital place in the lives of their families and communities. Business and professional men have regained their standing. There is scarcely any form of trouble and misery which has not been overcome among us. In one western city and its environs there are one thousand of us and our families. We meet frequently so that newcomers may find the fellowship they seek. At these informal gatherings one may often see from 50 to 200 persons. We are growing in numbers and power.**.

An alcoholic in his cups is an unlovely creature. Our struggles with them are variously strenuous, comic, and tragic. One poor chap committed suicide in my home. He could not, or would not see our way of life.

There is, however, a vast amount of fun about it all. I suppose some would be shocked at our seeming worldliness and levity. But just underneath there is deadly earnestness. Faith has to work twenty-four hours a day in and through us, or we perish.

Most of us feel we need look no further for Utopia. We have it with us right here and now. Each day my friend's simple talk in our kitchen multiplies itself in a widening circle of peace on earth and good will to men.

Bill W., co-founder of A.A., died January 24, 1971
