### Step 5

<i>**Charlie**: Okay, let's go to page 72, Into Action. We want to run very briefly through steps 5, 6, and 7, then we'll take our break. Okay?
</i>

<i>**Joe**: So we go to page 72 Into Action. This is not "Into Thinking", it's "Into Action". It says
</i>

**Bill (read by Joe)**: <span class="bg-prayer">Having made our personal inventory, what shall we do about it?</span> We have been trying to get a new attitude, 

<i>**Joe**: Remember Dr. Jung said ideas, emotions and attitudes are the guiding force of all these people, must be cast to one side. We're trying to get a new attitude, and 
</i>

**Bill (read by Joe)**: a new relationship with our Creator, 

<i>**Joe**: And our book said back on page 45 that 
</i>

**Bill (paraphrased by Joe)**: <span class="text-muted"> Its main object is to enable you to find a Power greater than yourself which will solve your problem.</span>

**Bill (read by Joe)**: and to discover the obstacles in our path. 

<i>**Joe**: And what are some of the obstacles? The resentment, the fear, the harms to other people.
</i>

**Bill (read by Joe)**: We have admitted certain defects; 

<i>**Joe**: And what are these defects? Selfish, self-seeking, frightening insonsiderate attitudes.
</i>

**Bill (read by Joe)**: <span class="bg-warning">we have ascertained in a rough way what the trouble is; we have put our finger on the weak times in our personal inventory.</span> <span class="bg-promise">Now these are about to be cast out.</span> <span class="bg-direction">This requires action on our part, which, when completed, will mean that we have admitted to God, to ourselves, and to another human being, the exact nature of our defects.</span> This brings us to the Fifth Step in the program of recovery mentioned in the preceding chapter.

<i>**Charlie**: And we know that step 5 says
</i>

<p class="text-muted">
**Bill (paraphrased by Charlie)**: We admitted to God, to ourselves, and to another human being the exact nature of our wrongs.
</p>

<i>**Charlie**: But if you'll notice here in the narrative, he said the exact nature of our defects. And people used to ask Bill about this. And we've known two ladies who have worked with Bill, with and for him for years, and both tell us the same thing. They said Bill, why did you use the word "wrongs" in step 5, and yet in the narrative here in the book you used the word "defects". And by the way Bill, What's the difference anyhow? Between a wrong in 5 the defect in 6, and the shortcoming in 7. And they both said that Bill would just roar back and smile, and say "When he took English in writing courses in college, they tought me not to use the same word over and over. Shows how dumb you are." He said there really are no differences in these things." He said "In step 4 we find those things that block us off from God." "In Step 5 we're going to talk about them to another human being. In Step 6 we're going to become willing to turn them loose. In Step 7 we're going to ask God to take them away. You can call them anything you want to. A wrong, a fault, a mistake, a defect, a personality flaw, or whatever." And we're going to notice in the next couple of pages, thats exactly what he does with them. I followed it up in the 12 and 12 13 years later not only does he do it there, but he does it twice as bad as he does it in the Big Book. Using these words interchangably back and forth, all of them meaning identically the same thing.
</i>

### Difficult, not easy (AR)

**Bill (read by Joe)**: This is perhaps difficult--especially discussing our defects 

<i>**Joe**: There is that word again again
</i>

<i>**Charlie**: He did it again, right there
</i>

**Bill (read by Joe)**: with another person. We think we have done well enough in admitting these things to ourselves. There is doubt about that. In actual practice, we usually find a <span class="bg-warning">solitary self-appraisal insufficient</span>. Many of us thought it necessary to go much further. We will be more reconciled to discussing ourselves with another person when we see good reasons why we should do so. The best reason first: If we skip this vital step, we may not overcome drinking. 

<i>**Joe**: You know, I take these forms now very vital information.
</i>

<p class="text-muted">

<i>**Joe**: I did the very best I could do filling out these forms with the limited knowledge that I had from experience, but I did the best I could do. 

point now there is vital information. The book says it's very simple. I did the very best 
</i>

<i>**Joe**: Now I take these to another human being and discuss them from left to right, all the way accross. Someone else who has gone on before me and done the inventory according to the Big Book and now that person is going to help me to glean more information out of each of these situations that is going to help me. I need that information, because the

**Bill (read by Joe)**: solitary self-appraisal insufficient
</p>

<i>**Joe**: For example, looking around this room, today, this weekend, I've noticed 2 or 3 character defects. There are a couple of them sitting right over there.
</i>

<i>**Charlie**: One is sitting right here in the front row.
</i>

<i>**Joe**: Several of them, as a matter of fact. It's real easy for me to look at you, and see your defects of character. There's nothing between you and me except air. But it's very, very difficult for me to look at me and see the truth, and see my defects of character. Beacuse there's years and a lifetime of rationalization and justifiction for these attitudes. And I need another human being to be able to look at me objectively and to help me see things that I couldn't see. Beacuse I'm starting out on a brand new lifetime engagement here, and I need all the information that I can get to have a very sucesssful life. I did the very best I could do in the inventory process, but a

### Finish your house cleaning (PLBB)

<p class="text-muted">
Time after time newcomers have tried to keep to themselves certain facts about their lives. Trying to avoid this humbling experience, they have turned to easier methods. Almost invariably they got drunk. Having persevered with the rest of the program, they wondered why they fell. We think the reason is that they never completed their housecleaning. They took inventory all right, but hung on to some of the worst items in stock. They only thought they had lost their egoism and fear; they only thought they had humbled themselves.
</p>

**Bill (read by Charlie)**: But they had not learned enough of humility, fearlessness and honesty, in the sense we find it necessary, until they told someone else all their life story.

<i>**Charlie**: Now there's the statement that got us confused about Step 4. And we all began to write our life story thinking that would be step 4. But we can see 90% of our life story, really doesn't have anything to do with our alcoholism. In fact I was born in 1929, but that really don't have anything to do with it. But I tell you what I have done. If I have taken the inventory the way that the book says, then I have shared my life story in those areas that really count. Resentments didn't come in my head just today. They've been popping in my head as far back as I can remember. I've shared all my life story resentment-wise. Fear's didn't come just today. They've been coming in my head as far back as I can remember. I've have shared all my life story fears-wise. The harms I've done to other people, I didn't hurt them just yesterday. I've been hurting people as far back as I can remember. My mother said to me one time, "Charlie, you were the meanest kid I ever saw." She said, "I had a little problem loving you myself." When mama don't love you, you're pretty bad off. And as I look at these things today, my whole life is centered around those three things: those resentments, those fears, and those harms I've done to others. So I don't have any quarrel with that statment at all, anymore. If we've done our inventory the way the book says, we've shared our life story. Now here's why we need to share it with another human being. 
</i>

**Bill (read by Charlie)**: More than most people, the alcoholic leads a double life. He is very much the actor. To the outer world he presents his stage character. This is the one he likes his fellows to see. He wants to enjoy a certain reputation, but knows in his heart he doesn't deserve it.

<i>**Charlie**: A practicing alcoholic is trying to live 2 lives. You know we've got a conscience. Whenever we are sober, we try to live like people are supposed to live, but when we're drinking, since alcohol lowers the inhibitions, we would probably do things that we would never think about doing sober. We're living two lifetimes when we're practicing alcoholic. 
</i>

**Bill (read by Charlie)**: The inconsistency is made worse by the things he does on his sprees. Coming to his senses, he is revolted at certain episodes he vaguely remembers. These memories are a nightmare. He trembles to think someone might have observed him. As far as he can, he pushes these memories far inside himself. He hopes they will never see the light of day. He is under constant fear and tension--that makes for more drinking.

<i>**Charlie**: You know let's face it we alcoholics have become the world's greatest con artists. You have to be. You couldn't live as a practicing alcoholic if you didn't learn how to lie, con, manipulate, steal, whatever is necessary. And I think the one we need to con the most is outselves, if we want to see what we're doing when we're drinking. But you see we got a little thing called resentments, and we use those resentments to transfer blame to others, and that way we can live with ourselves. Now if you've been doing that for 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 40 years. You come A.A. and you take step 4, and be just about an honest as you can with yourself, but let's face it, we can't be honest with ourselves. I now need to take my inventory, take it to another human being. One who has walked this walk before me, who understand 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, according to the Big Book. And have them see those things I can't see about me. They're not going to change anything in collumn 1. Not going to change anything in column 2. They'll probably change some things in Column 3. One place I said this was caused by the sex instinct, and he said "No it isn't" he said, "You're just trying to build your self-esteem. That's what you're trying to do." In the fifth column one place I said "This is caused by fear," and he said, "This is plain damn dishonesty. That's all this is." He helped me see things I couldn't see. We're getting ready to start a lifetime changing process. We need to be sure that we're trying to change the right things so we can have peace of mind in the future, and we just can't see it by ourselves. Now I know confession is good for the soul. And I know that if you belong to a congregation that requires that, then you ought to do that. But I still think you ought to take your inventory to somebody in A.A., preferrably a good sponsor, if you got one that knows the program. The main thing is do they really know the program, if they do then they can help us. If they' don't, then all we're going to get out of it is confession. We need more than that.
</i>

<i>**Charlie**: Page 74 tells people how to pick somebody. That is not valid like it was in 1939. In 1939 the first person our here that got this Big Book didn't have any other A.A. members to find a sponsor. And it was difficult for them to find somebody to do Step 5 with. That's what page 74 deals with. But today, there's plenty of people our here in California that understand this program, that have worked this program that have walked this step before. That's who we need to select to take Step 5 with. Hopefully, it will be our sponsor. Page 75 tells us how to do it.
</i>

### Entirely Honest

<div class="text-muted">
Psychologists are inclined to agree with us. We have spent thousands of dollars for examinations. We know but few instances where we have given these doctors a fair break. We have seldom told them the whole truth nor have we followed their advice. Unwilling to be honest with these sympathetic men, we were honest with no one else. Small wonder many in the medical profession have a low opinion of alcoholics and their chance for recovery!

We must be entirely honest with somebody if we expect to live long or happily in this world. Rightly and naturally, we think well before we choose the person or persons with whom to take this intimate and confidential step. Those of us belonging to a religious denomination which requires confession must, and of course, will want to go to the properly appointed authority whose duty it is to receive it. Though we have no religious conception, we may still do well to talk with someone ordained by an established religion. We often find such a person quick to see and understand our problem. Of course, we sometimes encounter people who do not understand alcoholics.

If we cannot or would rather not do this, we search our acquaintance for a close-mouthed, understanding friend. Perhaps our doctor or psychologist will be the person. It may be one of our own family, but we cannot disclose anything to our wives or our parents which will hurt them and make them unhappy. We have no right to save our own skin at another person's expense. Such parts of our story we tell to someone who will understand, yet be unaffected. The rule is we must be hard on ourself, but always considerate of others.

Notwithstanding the great necessity for discussing ourselves with someone, it may be one is so situated that there is no suitable person available. If that is so, this step may be postponed, only, however, if we hold ourselves in complete readiness to go through with it at the first opportunity. We say this because we are very anxious that we talk to the right person. It is important that he be able to keep a confidence; that he fully understand and approve what we are driving at; that he will not try to change our plan. But we must not use this as a mere excuse to postpone.
</div>

### Waste No Time

**Bill (read by Joe)**: When we decide who is to hear our story, we waste no time. 

<i>**Joe**: There's that time factor again.
</i>

**Bill (read by Joe)**: We have a written inventory and we are prepared for a long talk. We explain to our partner what we are about to do and why we have to do it. He should realize that we are engaged upon a life-and-death errand. Most people approached in this way will be glad to help; they will be honored by our confidence.


<i>**Joe**: I'll never forget, I called my sponsor Franklin. I called Franklin and said, "can I come over this weekend and do my inventory?" And he said, "Sure, I'd love you have you come over." So I went over there to Olive Branch, MS, and I sat down there with Franklin and says "Well I've got it all prepared there and I appreciate it." He said "I know you do, and I'm ready to get started." He said, "First of all, let's you and I do the 3rd step prayer together." That's the kind of sponsor I have, and we asked God to be with us together during this process. And we did that, and we sat about, delving into this inventory process. And Franklin helped me see things that I couldn't see. I shared these things with him left to right, all the way accross. And he asked me questions and helped me see things I couldn't see. He shared with me things that had happened to him. It helped me a whole lot. After that weekend was over
</i>

**Bill (read by Joe)**: We pocket our pride and go to it, illuminating every twist of character, every dark cranny of the past. Once we have taken this step, withholding nothing, we are delighted. 

<i>**Charlie**: Now we see the results.
</i>

**Bill (read be Joe)**: We can look the world in the eye. We can be alone at perfect peace and ease. Our fears fall from us. We begin to feel the nearness of our Creator. We may have had certain spiritual beliefs, but now we begin to have a spiritual experience. 


<i>**Charlie**: We believed in Step 2, now we begin to have a spiritual experience.
</i>

**Bill (read be Joe)**: The feeling that the drink problem has disappeared will often come strongly. We feel we are on the Broad Highway, walking hand in hand with the Spirit of the Universe.

<i>**Joe**: You know I remember back when I was drinking my mind used to race uncontrolably, and that's the main reason why I drank, was to stop that. When I did this step, I was on my way home that afternoon, I used to lay awake. If I could just get it all back to zero all situations, just one time, then I would be okay. This time I could see that I could do that. I was looking forward to the next step because I wanted to get things squared away, just one time. I thanked God all the way home for this process up to this point.
</i>

<i>**Charlie**: Now if you've done 4 and 5 in the Big Book, then you've done a lot of work. You probably need a little rest. The book is going to give us a little rest stop.
</i>

**Bill (read by Charlie)**: Returning home we find a place where we can be quiet for an hour, carefully reviewing what we have done. 

<i>**Charlie**: He didn't say 72 days. You see they mean for us to get on with this thing. Between 3 and 4, we get "at once", but now we get "an hour" rest here, but that's all.
</i>

**Bill (read by Charlie)**: We thank God from the bottom of our heart that we know Him better. We don't know Him yet, but we know him better. Taking this book down from our shelf we turn to the page which contains the twelve steps. Carefully reading the first five proposals 

<i>**Charlie**: Now he could have said the first five steps again, but he doesn't want to do it twice in a row. 
</i>

<p class="text-muted">
Carefully reading the first five proposals 
</p>

**Bill (read by Charlie)**: we ask if we have omitted anything, for we are building an arch through which we shall walk a free man at last. Is our work solid so far? Are the stones properly in place? Have we skimped on the cement put into the foundation? Have we tried to make mortar without sand?

<i>**Charlie**: And once again we are referring to the wonderfully effective spiritual structure, the personality change we're building.

- Step 1, willingness, was the foundation
- Step 2, believing, was the cornerstone
- Step 3, he told us it was the arch through which we will pass through to freedom, and 3 was the keystone

now we've put two more stones in place.
</i>

<!-- * END OF 5TH STEP (S5)
  -- BEGIN OF 6TH STEP (S6)

<hr/>

### Step 6

**Bill (read by Charlie)**: If we can answer to our satisfaction, we then look at STEP SIX. We have emphasized willingness as being indispensable. Are we now ready to let God remove from us all the things which we have admitted are objectionable? Can He now take them all--every one? If we still cling to something we will not let go, we ask God to help us be willing.

<i>**Charlie**: And that's all of step 6. And if you'll notice he didn't say a thing about defects of character, did he? He did say "we have admitted are objectionable" Now surely surely, in step 4 and 5 when we looked into that 5th column, and we saw that old selfish, dishonest, self-seeking, frightened, inconsiderate character that we have become. When we saw that those are what caused us to do the things that hurt poeple. They in turn retalliate, we in turn resent or are afraid, filled with guilt, fear and remorse, which causes us to drink. Surely those things in the 5th column have now become objectionable to us. Are we ready to turn them loose? If we are, we're through with Step 6. The book recognises though that self cannot always overcome self. Because it says if we're not ready, we ask for God to help us be willing to turn these things loose. Now you would think when we see what they do to us we'd be more than willing, but sometimes we're not. You know we human beings are funny people, sometimes we would rather sit in today's pain and suffering, because we kind of learn how to take care of that. Sometimes we'd rather sit in today's pain and suffering than take a chance on changing in the future because we don't know what change will bring. You see if I have to get rid of my selfishness and become unselfish, then how am I going to get what I want in the future? If I'm going to have to get rid of my dishonesty, and start operating honestly, then how am I going to make a living? I don't know anything about honesty when I get here. If I'm going to have to start getting rid of my self-seeking, frightened character, and start acting on courage, that scares the hell out of me. I don't know anything about that. If I'm going to have to start considering other people their needs and their wants, then who's going to take care of me? Sometimes we'd rather sit in today's pain than take a chance on changing in the future. And the book recognized that, it says if you're not willing, you ask God to help you be willing. And with God's help we become willing, we're through with 6.
</i>

**Andrew**: Under every resentment is a fear of change.

<!-- * END OF 6TH STEP (S6)
  -- BEGIN OF 7TH STEP (S7)
  -->
<hr/>

### Step 7

**Bill (read by Charlie)**: When ready, we say something like this: "My Creator, I am now willing that you should have all of me, good and bad. I pray that you now remove from me every single defect of character"

<i>**Charlie**: Woah we're at step 7 now but it says shortcomings, but see what he's done to us? He confused the hell out of us, didn't he? You Betcha!
</i>

**Bill (read by Charlie)**: <span class="text-muted">"I pray that you now remove from me every single defect of character"</span>

**Bill (read by Charlie)**: "which stands in the way of my usefulness to you and my fellows. Grant me strength, as I go out from here, to do your bidding. Amen." We have then completed STEP SEVEN.

<i>**Charlie**: Are you ready to have got remove them? If you are, then you're through with 6. Have you humbly asked Him to take them away? If you have, then you've done step 7. But I hope you don't make the same mistake I did. I assume that now that I'm ready, and God being all powerful, all I got to do is turn to God, and say "Okay, God, here I am, warts and all, zap me, and give my the $29.95 special, and I'll never have to worry about this stuff again. I found out it doesn't work that way. God will do what I can't do for myself. I simply do not have the power to remove the character defects. Only God has that power. God will not do for me what I can do for myself. And what I can do for myself is find out the opposite of that character defect. Then with God's help and all the willpower I can muster in every situation that comes up try to practice the opposite. God can't take away my selfishness and leave another hole in my head. It's going to have to be replaced with the opposite, which is unselfishness. And when I first got here, my mind was a set of mental habits ingrained in 30, 40 years of living. The habitual thing was for me to act seflishly. The only way to break the habit is to work against yourself. And If I ask God to take away selfishness and I start trying to practice unselfishness, then slowly the old habit dies, and the new habit takes its place. And over a period of years, I have become an unselfish human being. I am not what I was when I first got here. If I want God to take away dishonest, then I must do my part, which is to practice honesty in every situation that comes up, and God that's hard for me to do. That is so alien to my nature. And I can't practice honesty without God help. But with God's power, all the willpower I can muster I can force myself to be honest, and slowly the old idea dies, and a new one takes its place. The habitual thing for me today is to react to any situation with honesty. If I want God to take away fear, then I have to kick myself in the butt and practice courage. If I want him to take away inconsideration, then I must start considering other people and their needs and their wants, and slowly the old idea dies and the new idea takes it's place. The book says we were reborn. I am not what I used to be.

Now I'm not completeley unselfish, never will be I'm not always completely honest. Sometimes I'm afraid, and other times I'm inconsiderate, but the majority of the time, I'm an unselfish, honest, human being with courage, considering other people first. You know I think you and I are the lickiest people in the world. We have the opportunity through these little steps right here, to live two lifetimes in one lifetime. Most people out there are sick, most people are going to the grave sick, not even knowing that they're sick. We not only know that we're sick, we know what's wrong with us, we found it in Steps 4 and 5, and in 6 and 7 do something about it, and we can become entirely different human being. Most people don't get that opportunity. Now be careful, for God's sake be careful. Because if you really accept this as the correct thing, the right thing, then that means from this day on you are responsible for what you are. I can't blame it on Barbara any longer. I can't blame it on mom and dad, I can't blame it on God, and I can't blame it on society. If I stay selfish, dishonest, self-seeking and inconsiderate, it's gotta be because that's the way I want to be. I no longer have the luxury of blaming it on others, because I don't have to be that way. You know what I found out? I found out that when you become unselfish, people start liking you a little better than they did before. I found out when you start becoming honest, well hell you feel better about yourself. That's the way to build self-esteem. Is to do the right thing for a change. I found out that when I practice with courage, and operate on courage instead of fear, I do things that makes me feel better. I quit doing things that make me feel so bad. I found out that there is real pleasure in considering other people first, and giving to others before you take for yourself. I didn't know that, how the hell could I know that, I've never been that way before. This absolutely amazes me and what happens to us and the simplicity of this thing, if we just do what the book says. Joe?
</i>

<i>**Joe**: You know, there's always a paradox in A.A. To give you an idea of what a paradox is, how many of you have ever called your sponsor so you could listen. We always call them so we can talk, right? That's the paradox. The paradox in these 2 steps is that they use the Doctor's Opinion and the first 4 chapters to do steps 1 and 2. Three and a half pages for step 3, 8 pages for step 4, 4 pages for step 5, and a whole chapter devoted to working with others. The paradox is that the two of the biggest steps in all of A.A. is on two little paragraphs: 6 and 7. And these are the tools of change. These are the tools of acceptance. A lot of people talk about just running around accepting things. I accept this, I accept that. Well I can't do that, acceptance comes after some actions. 6 and 7. The acceptance comes after the actions of steps 6 and 7. You know there's a story in another book about this guy names Judas. Judas could not accept what he had done, and what did he do? He killed himself, that's the importance of acceptance. You can't accept anything unless you have taken some actions. The other story is that there's a story in this other book about this guy named Soul. Soul was riding his ass on the way to Damascus. Big bolt of lightning knocked him off his ass on his ass that's the way I read it. He dusted himself off, and a big voice comes out of the sky and says "Can we talk?" "Yeah we can talk" "What do you want to talk about?" That got his attention didn't he? Maybe alcohol can get our attention. He said "Saul you've been a very selfish individual, you've harmed a lot of people by those attitudes, and I want you to quit doing that." He said "How do you quit doing that?" He said "Well do these things, and if you do that, then you'll make a change and when you change, then we'll call you Paul." Well he did those things, and became Paul. Now we know that Paul was one of the greatest writers that the world has ever known. In the town of Corithians, they asked Paul one day. "Paul, what is the secret to living?" "The secret to living is daily dying." The old Saul had to die so that the new Paul came alive. 6 and 7. By the time I got to 6 and 7 I could see what I had become as a result of the previous steps, and I didn't like what I had become. A little doubt creeped in my mind and God really changed me from what I had become to what he intends for me to be. I had to reaffirm and really think about this idea, on page 53 it said. "God either is or he isn't" Either he can or he can't, what was my choice gonna be? And I chose to believe that He could. The tools of change to change from what I had become to that which God intended for me, 6 and 7. Two of the biggest steps in A.A.

<i>**Charlie**: Just before the break, I want Joe to tell you one little story about buying some salad.

<i>**Joe**: ...
</i>

<i>**Charlie**: and become different human beings. So if you stay dishonest, self-seeking, frightened and inconsideration, it must be because you want to.
</i>

<!-- * END OF 7TH STEP (S7)

<hr/>

### Step 8

<i>**Charlie**: We've completed our first 7 steps. Knowing full well that we're going to be working on 6 and 7 for the rest of our lives, really. Trying to change as the opportunity comes up. 

**Charlie**: Now we've read in the book where we are spiritually sick, mentally sick, and physically sick. And it says, "When the spiritual malady is overcome, we straighten out mentally and physically." And we begin to look at those things and begin to realize that all human beings really are born to live in 3 dimensions of life.

**Charlie**: You know, if God dwells in each of us, we're going to have to live with God whether we like it or not is besides the point. The only question is: do we live in harmony or disharmony? I don't know of anyone who got in more disharmony with God than we alcoholics have. 

**Charlie**: We also have what we call the mental dimension. We've all got a mind--sometimes we act like we don't--but we do. We have to live with our mind; whether we like it or not is besides the point. We don't have any choice. Again, do we live there in harmony or disharmony? I don't know of any group of people who got more fouled up in their head than we alcoholics have. 

**Charlie**: For years, I thought the physical dimension was my body only. Today I realize that the physical dimension is the world and everything in it, period. Now, we alcoholics don't have any place else to live except here on Earth. We don't have any choice in the matter; whether we like it or not is besides the point. The only question is: do we live on Earth with our fellow man in harmony or disharmony? I don't know of any group of people that got more fouled up in a relationship with the world and everybody in it than we alcoholics have. 

**Charlie**: So, we were sick spiritually, mentally, and physically. The book talks about a design for living, and it looks to us like these steps are designed in such a manner to put us back together and make us well in all three dimensions of life, as God intended for us to be in the first place. 

**Charlie**: Steps One, Two, Three we got right with the spirit. Because we were powerless, we saw the need for the Power. Step Three--we decided to go after that Power and we made a decision that God was going to be the director that He's the Father, we are the children; he's the employer, we're the employee. For most of us, that's the first time we've had that relationship with God for a long, long, long time. We got the right relationship in Steps 1, 2, and 3.

**Charlie**: That removed just enough self-will to let us begin to look into our own minds. In Steps 4 and 5, we found out those things that block us off from God, that block us off from our fellow man, that create the resentments and the fears and the guilts and etc. And we begin to work on those in Steps 6 and 7. So we begin to get right in our minds through Steps 4, 5, 6, and 7.

**Charlie**: Now, that removes just enough self-will to begin to look at our relationship with the world and everybody in it. Now through 4, 5, 6, and 7, we got rid of these resentments up here, we got rid of these fears up here to the level God intended for them to be. But we really haven't done anything about the storeroom back here that's filled with guilt and remorse associated with the harms we've done in the past.

**Charlie**: If we want to get right in the physical dimension--our relationship with the world and everybody in it--it's long been known that the way you do that is to make restitution for the things done in the past. Then the guilt and remorse begin to disappear.

**Charlie**: Now, I've never yet seen a newcomer come into a meeting and read the steps off the wall and say, "I can hardly wait until we get to Steps 8 and 9 it looks like a lot of fun!" Nobody likes to do Steps 8 and 9. Nobody that I've ever met. Some people might, but not that I know. The only question is: can we afford not to do that?

**Charlie**: The guilt and remorse in here--it is kind of keeps chewing at us. And after a while, it begins to bother our relationship with the world and everybody in it. And we start getting sick in our head, and after awhile that blocks us off from God, and we end up drunk.

**Charlie**: You know, when we read the foreword to the second edition, it sounded as though Dr. Bob never took another drink after Bill visited with him the first time. That isn't true. Dr. Bob had one more drunk left in him. Not too long after Bill called on him and they began to try to work with people, Bob found it necessary to go to a medical convention. And his wife Anne begged Bill not to let him go. "No," said Bill, "If he goes over there, he'll get drunk. He does it every year." And Bill said, "Let him go. He's got to learn to live in society where there's always going to be plenty of alcohol."

**Charlie**: Bob went to the medical convention, got drunk, came back to Akron, OH, and showed up at his nurse's home. She called Anne and said, "Come and get him, he's drunk." And she said, "Get him sobered up, he's got surgery in the morning. He's the only doctor on staff right now that can do this particular surgery."

**Charlie**: Dr. Bob was a proctologist. Whatever your procto is, I'm glad he wasn't working on mine the next morning.

**Charlie**: I know that they went over and got him, brought him back to Dr. Bob's house, and they coffeed him and fed him and they walked him and they sobered him to the best of their ability. The next morning, Bill took him to the hospital to do the surgery. In the parking lot at the hospital, Dr. Bob said "Bill, I can't do this surgery." He said "I'm sick and I'm shaking and I'm trembling and I'm gonna hurt somebody bad."

**Charlie**: Bill reached in the back seat of the car, got out a bottle of beer, popped the top on it, and said, "Drink this and you'll be okay." Dr. Bob drank the beer, went upstairs, did the surgery and sure enough, it came out okay. 

**Charlie**: Now the only problem is--he disappears. Bill's waiting on him down in the parking lot. He waits 2 or 3 or 4 hours. He assumes that the beer's triggered the allergy and Bob's off and running. He goes back to Dr. Bob's house. Doesn't see him. Waits all afternoon. Late, late, late evening, Dr. Bob shows up--and he's sober.

**Charlie**: Bill said, "Where the hell have you been?"

**Charlie**: He said, "I've been going up and down both sides of the street making my amends to those I've harmed in the past."

**Charlie**: That bottle of beer was the last drink Dr. Bob took--January the 10th 1935--which is A.A.'s birthday. He never would make amends before because he was afraid people would find out he was alcoholic and he would lose what little practice he had left. He didn't know that everybody already knew he was alcoholic.

**Charlie**: The day he screwed up the courage--mustered up enough courage to make his amends was the day he took his last drink

**Charlie**: Now, I would assume, if it's good enough for Bob, then it's probably good enough for me too. 

**Charlie**: Let's look at Steps 8 and 9 for just a few minutes. We're not going to go through them in great detail--just a few minutes.
</i>

**Bill (read by Joe)**: Now we need more action, without which we find that "Faith without works is dead." Let's look at STEPS EIGHT AND NINE. 

<i>**Joe**: You know generally if you go to a step study meeting and they begin to talk about Step 8 generally the conversation will go over to how they made amends in step 9 but Step 8 is a definite step and it's a step that needs to be done he said 
</i>

**Bill (read by Joe)**: We have a list of all persons we have harmed and to whom we are willing to make amends. We made it when we took inventory. 

<i>**Joe**: We simply take all those names all those names off of column one off of those four sheets anyone that we've harmed we put them on one long sheet haven't made any amends yet we just made the list and then the book says 
</i>

We subjected ourselves to a drastic self-appraisal. 

<i>**Joe**: We did that in Steps Four and Five a drastic self-appraisal.
</i>

Now we go out to our fellows and repair the damage done in the past. We attempt to sweep away the debris which has accumulated out of our effort to live on self-will and run the show ourselves. If we haven't the will to do this, we ask until it comes. 

<i>**Joe**: More prayer in Step 8 again real simple we make the list we become willing to the list and if we're not willing we ask God to help us to become willing we haven't made any amends yet that's Step 8 we do that and then we've completed step 8

Remember it was agreed at the BEGINNING WE WOULD GO TO ANY LENGTHS FOR VICTORY OVER ALCOHOL.

<div class="text-muted">
Probably there are still some misgivings. As we look over the list of business acquaintances and friends we have hurt, we may feel diffident about going to some of them on a spiritual basis. Let us be reassured. To some people we need not, and probably should not emphasize the spiritual feature on our first approach. We might prejudice them. At the moment we are trying to put our lives in order. But this is not an end in itself. Our real purpose is to fit ourselves to be of maximum service to God and the people about us. It is seldom wise to approach an individual, who still smarts from our injustice to him, and announce that we have gone religious. In the prize ring, this would be called leading with the chin. Why lay ourselves open to being branded fanatics or religious bores? We may kill a future opportunity to carry a beneficial message. But our man is sure to be impressed with a sincere desire to set right the wrong. He is going to be more interested in a demonstration of good will than in our talk of spiritual discoveries.

We don't use this as an excuse for shying away from the subject of God. When it will serve any good purpose, we are willing to announce our convictions with tact and common sense. The question of how to approach the man we hated will arise. It may be he has done us more harm than we have done him and, though we may have acquired a better attitude toward him, we are still not too keen about admitting our faults. Nevertheless, with a person we dislike, we take the bit in our teeth. It is harder to go to an enemy than to a friend, but we find it much more beneficial to us. We go to him in a helpful and forgiving spirit, confessing our former ill feeling and expressing our regret.

Under no condition do we criticize such a person or argue. Simply tell him that we will never get over drinking until we have done our utmost to straighten out the past. We are there to sweep off our side of the street, realizing that nothing worth while can be accomplished until we do so, never trying to tell him what he should do. His faults are not discussed. We stick to our own. If our manner is calm, frank, and open, we will be gratified with the result.

In nine cases out of ten the unexpected happens. Sometimes the man we are calling upon admits his own fault, so feuds of years' standing melt away in an hour. Rarely do we fail to make satisfactory progress. Our former enemies sometimes praise what we are doing and wish us well. Occasionally, they will offer assistance. It should not matter, however, if someone does throw us out of his office. We have made our demonstration, done our part. It's water over the dam.

Most alcoholics owe money. We do not dodge our creditors. Telling them what we are trying to do, we make no bones about our drinking; they usually know it anyway, whether we think so or not. Nor are we afraid of disclosing our alcoholism on the theory it may cause financial harm. Approached in this way, the most ruthless creditor will sometimes surprise us. Arranging the best deal we can we let these people know we are sorry. Our drinking has made us slow to pay. We must lose our fear of creditors no matter how far we have to go, for we are liable to drink if we are afraid to face them.

Perhaps we have committed a criminal offense which might land us in jail if it were known to the authorities. We may be short in our accounts and unable to make good. We have already admitted this in confidence to another person, but we are sure we would be imprisoned or lose our job if it were known. Maybe it's only a petty offense such as padding the expense account. Most of us have done that sort of thing. Maybe we are divorced, and have remarried but haven't kept up the alimony to number one. She is indignant about it, and has a warrant out for our arrest. That's a common form of trouble too.

Although these reparations take innumerable forms, there are some general principles which we find guiding. Reminding ourselves that we have decided to go to any lengths to find a spiritual experience, we ask that we be given strength and direction to do the right thing, no matter what the personal consequences may be. We may lose our position or reputation or face jail, but we are willing. We have to be. We must not shrink at anything.

Usually, however, other people are involved. Therefore, we are not to be the hasty and foolish martyr who would needlessly sacrifice others to save himself from the alcoholic pit. A man we know had remarried. Because of resentment and drinking, he had not paid alimony to his first wife. She was furious. She went to court and got an order for his arrest. He had commenced our way of life, had secured a position, and was getting his head above water. It would have been impressive heroics if he had walked up to the Judge and said, "Here I am."

We thought he ought to be willing to do that if necessary, but if he were in jail he could provide nothing for either family. We suggested he write his first wife admitting his faults and asking forgiveness. He did, and also sent a small amount of money. He told her what he would try to do in the future. He said he was perfectly willing to go to jail is she insisted. Of course she did not, and the whole situation has long since been adjusted.

Before taking drastic action which might implicate other people we secure their consent. If we have obtained permission, have consulted with others, asked God to help and the drastic step is indicated we must not shrink.

This brings to mind a story about one of our friends. While drinking, he accepted a sum of money from a bitterly-hated business rival, giving him no receipt for it. He subsequently denied having received the money and used the incident as a basis for discrediting the man. He thus used his own wrong-doing as a means of destroying the reputation of another. In fact, his rival was ruined.

He felt that he had done a wrong he could not possibly make right. If he opened that old affair, he was afraid it would destroy the reputation of his partner, disgrace his family and take away his means of livelihood. What right had he to involve those dependent upon him? How could he possibly make a public statement exonerating his rival?

After consulting with his wife and partner he came to the conclusion that it was better to take those risks than to stand before his Creator guilty of such ruinous slander. He saw that he had to place the outcome in God's hands or he would soon start drinking again, and all would be lost anyhow. He attended church for the first time in many years. After the sermon, he quietly got up and made an explanation. His action met widespread approval, and today he is one of the most trusted citizens of his town. This all happened years ago.

The chances are that we have domestic troubles. Perhaps we are mixed up with women in a fashion we wouldn't care to have advertised. We doubt if, in this respect, alcoholics are fundamentally much worse than other people. But drinking does complicate sex relations in the home. After a few years with an alcoholic, a wife get worn out, resentful and uncommunicative. How could she be anything else? The husband begins to feel lonely, sorry for himself. He commences to look around in the night clubs, or their equivalent, for something besides liquor. Perhaps he is having a secret and exciting affair with "the girl who understands." In fairness we must say that she may understand, but what are we going to do about a thing like that? A man so involved often feels very remorseful at times, especially if he is married to a loyal and courageous girl who has literally gone through hell for him.

Whatever the situation, we usually have to do something about it. If we are sure our wife does not know, should we tell here? Not always, we think. If she knows in a general way that we have been wild, should we tell her it detail? Undoubtedly we should admit our fault. She may insist on knowing all the particulars. She will want to know who the woman is and where she is. We feel we ought to say to her that we have no right to involve another person. We are sorry for what we have done and, God willing, it shall not be repeated. More than that we cannot do; we have no right to go further. Though there may be justifiable exceptions, and though we wish to lay down no rule of any sort, we have often found this the best course to take.

Our design for living is not a one-way street. It is as good for the wife as for the husband. If we can forget, so can she. It is better, however, that one does not needlessly name a person upon whom she can vent jealousy.

Perhaps there are some cases where the utmost frankness is demanded. No outsider can appraise such an intimate situation. It may be that both will decide that the way of good sense and loving kindness is to let by-gones be by-gones. Each might pray about it, having the other one's happiness uppermost in mind. Keep it always in sight that we are dealing with that most terrible human emotion--jealousy. Good generalship may decide that the problem be attacked on the flank rather than risk a face-to-face combat.

If we have no such complication, there is plenty we should do at home. Sometimes we hear an alcoholic say that the only thing he needs to do is to keep sober. Certainly he must keep sober, for there will be no home if he doesn't. But he is yet a long way from making good to the wife or parents whom for years he has so shockingly treated. Passing all understanding is the patience mothers and wives have had with alcoholics. Had this not been so, many of us would have no homes today, would perhaps be dead.

The alcoholic is like a tornado roaring his way through the lives of others. Hearts are broken. Sweet relationships are dead. Affections have been uprooted. Selfish and inconsiderate habits have kept he home in turmoil. We feel a man is unthinking when he says that sobriety is enough. He is like the farmer who came up out of his cyclone cellar to find his home ruined. To his wife, he remarked, "Don't see anything the matter here, Ma. Ain't it grand the wind stopped blowin'?"

Yes, there is a long period of reconstruction ahead. We must take the lead. A remorseful mumbling that we are sorry won't fill the bill at all. We ought to sit down with the family and frankly analyze the past as we now see it, being very careful not to criticize them. Their defects may be glaring, but the chances are that our own actions are partly responsible. So we clean house with the family, asking each morning in meditation that our Creator show us the way of patience, tolerance, kindliness and love.

The spiritual life is not a theory. WE HAVE TO LIVE IT. Unless one's family expresses a desire to live upon spiritual principles we think we ought not to urge them. We should not talk incessantly to them about spiritual matters. They will change in time. Our behavior will convince them more than our words. We must remember that ten or twenty years of drunkenness would make a skeptic out of anyone.

There may be some wrongs we can never fully right. We don't worry about them if we can honestly say to ourselves that we would right them if we could. Some people cannot be seen--we sent them an honest letter. And there may be a valid reason for postponement in some cases. But we don't delay if it can be avoided. We should be sensible, tactful, considerate and humble without being servile or scraping. As God's people we stand on our feet; we don't crawl before anyone.

If we are painstaking about this phase of our development, we will be amazed before we are half way through. We are going to know a new freedom and a new happiness. We will not regret the past nor wish to shut the door on it. We will comprehend the word serenity and we will know peace. No matter how far down the scale we have gone, we will see how our experience can benefit others. That feeling of uselessness and self-pity will disappear. We will lose interest in selfish things and gain interest in our fellows. Self-seeking will slip away. Our whole attitude and outlook upon life will change. Fear of people and of economic insecurity will leave us. We will intuitively know how to handle situations which used to baffle us. We will suddenly realize that God is doing for us what we could not do for ourselves.

Are these extravagant promises? We think not. They are being fulfilled among us--sometimes quickly, sometimes slowly. They will always materialize if we work for them.

This thought brings us to STEP TEN, which suggests we continue to take personal inventory and continue to set right any new mistakes as we go along. We vigorously commenced this way of living as we cleaned up the past. We have entered the world of the Spirit. Our next function is to grow in understanding and effectiveness. This is not an overnight matter. It should continue for our lifetime. Continue to watch for selfishness (`A2`), dishonesty (`A1`), resentment (`A2`), and fear (`A3`). When these crop up, we ask God at once to remove them. We discuss them with someone immediately and make amends quickly if we have harmed anyone. Then we resolutely turn our thoughts to someone we can help. Love and tolerance of others is our code.

And we have ceased fighting anything or anyone--even alcohol. For by this time sanity will have returned. We will seldom be interested in liquor. If tempted, we recoil from it as from a hot flame. We react sanely and normally, and we will find that this has happened automatically. We will see that our new attitude toward liquor has been given us without any thought or effort on our part. It just comes! That is the miracle of it. We are not fighting it, neither are we avoiding temptation. We feel as though we had been placed in a position of neutrality--safe and protected. We have not even sworn off. Instead, the problem has been removed. It does not exist for us. We are neither cocky nor are we afraid. That is our experience. That is how we react so long as we keep in fit spiritual condition.

It is easy to let up on the spiritual program of action and rest on our laurels. We are headed for trouble if we do, for alcohol is a subtle foe. We are not cured of alcoholism. What we really have is a daily reprieve contingent on the maintenance of our spiritual condition. Every day is a day when we must carry the vision of God's will into all of our activities. "How can I best serve Thee--Thy will (not mine) be done." These are thoughts which must go with us constantly. We can exercise our will power along this line all we wish. It is the proper use of the will.

Much has already been said about receiving strength, inspiration, and direction from Him who has all knowledge and power. If we have carefully followed directions, we have begun to sense the flow of His Spirit into us. To some extent we have become God-conscious. We have begun to develop this vital sixth sense. But we must go further and that means more action.

STEP ELEVEN suggests prayer and meditation. We shouldn't be shy on this matter of prayer. Better men than we are using it constantly. It works, if we have the proper attitude and work at it. It would be easy to be vague about this matter. Yet, we believe we can make some definite and valuable suggestions.

When we retire at night, we constructively review our day. Were we resentful (`A2`), selfish (`A2`), dishonest (`A1`) or afraid (`A3`)? Do we owe an apology? Have we kept something to ourselves which should be discussed with another person at once? Were we kind and loving toward all? What could we have done better? Were we thinking of ourselves most of the time? Or were we thinking of what we could do for others, of what we could pack into the stream of life? But we must be careful not to drift into worry, remorse or morbid reflection, for that would diminish our usefulness to others. After making our review we ask God's forgiveness and inquire what corrective measures should be taken.

On awakening let us think about the twenty-four hours ahead. We consider our plans for the day. Before we begin, we ask God to direct our thinking, especially asking that it be divorced from self-pity, dishonest or self-seeking motives. Under these conditions we can employ our mental faculties with assurance, for after all God gave us brains to use. Our thought-life will be placed on a much higher plane when our thinking is cleared of wrong motives.

In thinking about our day we may face indecision. We may not be able to determine which course to take. Here we ask God for inspiration, an intuitive thought or a decision. we relax and take it easy. We don't struggle. We are often surprised how the right answers come after we have tried this for a while.

What used to be the hunch or the occasional inspiration gradually becomes a working part of the mind. Being still inexperienced and having just made conscious contact with God, it is not probable that we are going to be inspired at all times. We might pay for this presumption in all sorts of absurd actions and ideas. Nevertheless, we find that our thinking will, as time passes, be more and more on the plane of inspiration. We come to rely upon it.

We usually conclude the period of meditation with a prayer that we be shown all through the day what our next step is to be, that we be given whatever we need to take care of such problems. We ask especially for freedom from self-will, and are careful to make no request for ourselves only. We may ask for ourselves, however, if others will be helped. We are careful never to pray for our own selfish ends. Many of us have wasted a lot of time doing that and it doesn't work. You can easily see why.

If circumstances warrant, we ask our wives or friends to join us in morning meditation. If we belong to a religious denomination which requires a definite morning devotion, we attend to that also. If not members of religious bodies, we sometimes select and memorize a few set prayers which emphasize the principles we have been discussing. There are many helpful books also. Suggestions about these may be obtained from one's priest, minister, or rabbi. Be quick to see where religious people are right. Make use of what they offer.

As we go through the day we pause, when agitated or doubtful, and ask for the right thought or action. We constantly remind ourselves we are no longer running the show, humbly saying to ourselves many times each day "Thy will be done." We are then in much less danger of excitement, fear, anger, worry, self-pity, or foolish decisions. We become much more efficient. We do not tire so easily, for we are not burning up energy foolishly as we did when we were trying to arrange life to suit ourselves.
