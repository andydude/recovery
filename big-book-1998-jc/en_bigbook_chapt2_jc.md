<i>**Charlie**: And in this Chapter, There is a Solution, we're going to talk about two powers. We're going to talk about the power of the fellowship, and we're going to talk about the power of the vital spiritual experience. And if we who are powerless can get both of these powers in our lives, then maybe we can overcome alcoholism also.

On Page 17 for those who are powerless he writes the prescription. Here he talks about the two powers
</i>

<i>**Joe**: Ebby presented Bill with a solution, and now Bill is going to present us with the solution the same way. He said There is a Solution. And a friend of mine back home said there are many more types of solutions than there are people in A.A. And I said if you look at the chapter heading, it will tell you how many solutions there are. There is a Solution. One. He said, "We", and there's that big word, again.
</i>

**Bill (read by Joe)**: We, of Alcoholics Anonymous, know thousands of men and women who were once just as hopeless as Bill. Nearly all have recovered. They have solved the drink problem.

**Bill (read by Joe)**: We are average Americans. 

<i>**Joe**: Today we can say that we're average citizens of the world, because by my last count A.A. was in 154 countries around the world.
</i>

**Bill (read by Joe)**: All sections of this country and many of its occupations are represented, as well as many political, economic, social, and religious backgrounds. We are people who normally would not mix. 

<i>**Joe**: I think we got the most mixed up group of Alcoholics in this group this morning. If we didn't have Alcoholics Anonymous to talk about, or recovery therefrom, I wonder what we would drink about, I mean talk about. There's hardly anything. Told you I had a good memory, just short. We wouldn't have anything to talk about. It says
</i>

<p class="text-muted">**Bill (read by Joe)**: We are people who normally would not mix. 
</p>

**Bill (read by Joe)**: <span class="bg-promise">But there exists among us a fellowship, a friendliness, and an understanding which is indescribably wonderful.</span> 

<i>**Joe**: And I heard that this morning before the meeting all the talk and the laughter going on, that's the fellowship of Alcoholics Anonymous, the spirit of Alcoholics Anonymous, and I got sober on the spirit of Alcoholics Anonymous. That was the only thing that was keeping me here. So it's a powerful thing, the fellowship of Alcoholics Anonymous kept me sober for quite some time.
</i>

<i>**Charlie**: Now he's going to describe this fellowship of Alcoholics Anonymous. By talking about something that he assumes that we already know about it. You know the things, that we already know about it. All great teachers have always done this. When they wanted to teach you something new, they would talk to you first about something you already know, and use that as an example to teach you something new. You know we had a great teacher that lived 2000 years ago, and he was really good at this. When he wanted to teach something to a shephard, he would tell him a story about sheep. But if we wanted to teach the same thing to a fisherman, change his story, this time it would be about fish. Then when he went to the farmer he would talk about cattle and grains. All good teachers do this. Bill is going to use the example of the great passenger ship. He said
</i>

**Bill (read by Charlie)**: We are like the passengers of a great liner the moment after rescue from shipwreck when camaraderie, joyousness and democracy pervade the vessel from steerage to Captain's table. 

<i>**Charlie**: Bill is referring to a time in the '30s when your mode of transportation from one continent to another was by the great ocean liners, and on those great ocean liners they had what they called the steerage section and people who were immigrants that didn't have very much money, they usually booked passage in the steerage section. Way down in the bowels of the ship, very little fresh air, dormatory style living, I call it the cheese sandwich section, not very good down there. Now, if you had a little more money, though, and you wanted better accomodations, you could pay for 4th class, and come up a deck or two. Then you could go 3rd class, and come up another deck or two. Then you could go 2nd class, and come up another deck or two, and each time the accomodations and the food were better. If you had enough money, you could go in what they called 1st class. In 1st class they had big fine state rooms, they had great dining rooms, they had good food, fine waiters, access to fresh air all the time, but that still wasn't the most eliete place on the ship. If you had the right kind of money. Old Money. If you had the right religion, the right ethnic background, the right everything, you might be invited to dine at the Captain's table. Just a few select people could do that. And at the Captain's table, you had the best of everything. The best service, the best food, the best everything. Now it's a long, long ways from the Captain's table to the steerage section. And in the journey accross the ocean, those two people should never have met each other. In fact most of those ocean liners even had separate stairwells, so the first class people never even had to see those that rode in the steerage section. They had nothing whatsoever in common. Then I think about the Titanic, and the night it hit the iceberg, and these two guys are standing there on the rail of the ship. One of them has his tuxedo on, his shiny shoes and his little bow tie, and everything that goes with it. Standing next to him is the guy from the steerage section, got his old work overalls on, his old brogans, never wore a tie in his life. These guys had nothing whatsoever in common with each other, until they jumped overboard. And when they jumped overboard, and their butts hit that cold water, they had something in common. How in the Hell do we save ourselves? And they grabbed onto each other, and held onto each other, and I doubt very seriously if the man from the Captain's table asked for a financial statement from the man from the steerage section. And when these two guys were rescued, and brought back on another ship or back on land, there was a feeling amongst them which was indescribably wonderful. This has always been true, when people escape from a common peril, there is a feeling that ties them together, and it's one of the greatest feelings in the world, and that's what we got in the fellowship of Alcoholics Anonymous. We don't care who you are. We don't care where you came from. We don't care how much money you got. We don't care what you're education is. We don't care what your ethnic background is. What your religion is, or anything else. All we wanna know is are you an alcoholic? And if you are, then there is a feeling amongst us which is indescribably wonderful. Even though we are so different from each other, we are still bound together. Now watch him, he's going to give us a warning
</i>

**Bill (read by Charlie)**: <span class="bg-promise">Unlike the feelings of the ship's passengers, however, our joy in escape from disaster does not subside as we go our individual ways.</span> 

<i>**Charlie**: ... probably never to meet again. But we will always be alcoholic, and this feeling we have for each other never goes away, and we find it again in city, after city, after city, and country, after country after country. One of the greatest things I've been able to experience in my lifetime is to go to an A.A. meeting a foreign country and feel just exactly as good as I did at home. Even though I don't know those people, we are bound together, because we're alcoholics. 
</i>

**Bill (read by Charlie)**: The feeling of having shared in a common peril is one element in the powerful cement which binds us. But that in itself would never have held us together as we are now joined.

<i>**Charlie**: In other words this feeling for each other in this fellowship of Alcoholics Anonymous is one of the things that binds us together, but then he said that itself is not enough.
</i>

<span class="bg-promise">The tremendous fact for every one of us is that we have discovered a common solution. We have a way out on which we can absolutely agree, and upon which we can join in brotherly and harmonious action.</span> This is the great news this book carries to those who suffer from alcoholism.

<i>**Charlie**: Not the news of the fellowship, but the news of the common solution. And later on we're going to see what the common solution is the spiritual experience brought about through the program of action. Now if we could get the power of the fellowship, support system, help system, and if we could get the power of the spiritual experience, which changes us, and add the two together, then that will be enough power to overcome our powerlessness over alcohol, and we can recover from that condition. I think that one of the greatest tragedies that I see in the world today, and there's lots of tragedies going on in the world today. But the greatest tragedy that I see is we people who are in the fellowship of Alcoholics Anonymous are spending litterally hundreds of thousands of dollars, hundreds of thousands of men and women work hours trying to attract other alcoholics to the fellowship of Alcoholics Anonymous, when we've got thousands who are already members of Alcoholics Anonymous who are sitting around dying from untreated alcoholism. Because they're doing nothing about the common solution. And the reason they're doing nothing about the common solution is that nobody is telling them about it. Nobody is talking about it, nobody is saying: Look here's the program of action. Nobody's saying let me take you by the hand and walk with you, so you can have a spiritual experience. And they're fellowship only, and after awhile they go back to drinking. And they say "A.A. don't work for us." No, they didn't work for A.A. They didn't do the program. And again, it's not their fault. It's out fault, because we're not insisting that new people work the program of Alcoholics Anonymous. And we're letting them die around us. Thousands of us are dying every day, who are already members of the fellowship of Alcoholics Anonymous. I think it's our responsibility to see that every newcomer knows about page 17. And knows there are two powers, the power of the fellowship, and the power of the spiritual experience. And we're not going to recover without both of them. Now we might stay sober for awhile, but we're not going to recover from alcoholism, without both of them. No more preaching today. I can guarentee you that. Preached a little last night, preached just a little bit this morning. We'll try not to preach anymore.

A good textbook never tells you anything that it doesn't back up and prove it. The first half of this chapter is designed to show you and me why the fellowship alone is not sufficient. The last half of this chapter is used to show us the solution to alcoholism, the vital spiritual experience. Let's look for just a few minutes why fellowship is not sufficient, and then we'll take a break.

### The alcoholic illness (AR)

<div class="text-muted">
An illness of this sort--and we have come to believe it an illness--involves those about us in a way no other human sickness can. If a person has cancer all are sorry for him and no one is angry or hurt. But not so with the alcoholic illness, for with it there goes annihilation of all the things worth while in life. It engulfs all whose lives touch the sufferer's. It brings misunderstanding, fierce resentment, financial insecurity, disgusted friends and employers, warped lives of blameless children, sad wives and parents--anyone can increase the list.

<span class="bg-prayer">We hope this volume will inform and comfort those who are, or who may be affected. There are many.</span>
</div>

### Alcoholics who help each other feel understood (PLBB)

<div class="text-muted">
Highly competent psychiatrists who have dealt with us have found it sometimes impossible to persuade an alcoholic to discuss his situation without reserve. Strangely enough, wives, parents and intimate friends usually find us even more unapproachable than do the psychiatrist and the doctor.

<i class="bg-warning">But the ex-problem drinker who has found this solution, who is properly armed with facts about himself, can generally win the entire confidence of another alcoholic in a few hours. Until such an understanding is reached, little or nothing can be accomplished.
</i>

That the man who is making the approach has had the same difficulty, that he obviously knows what he is talking about, that his whole deportment shouts at the new prospect that he is a man with a real answer, that he has no attitude of Holier Than Thou, nothing whatever except the sincere desire to be helpful; that there are no fees to pay, no axes to grind, no people to please, no lectures to be endured--these are the conditions we have found most effective. After such an approach many take up their beds and walk again.
</div>

### Why was the Big Book created? (PLBB)

<div class="text-muted">
None of us makes a sole vocation of this work, nor do we think its effectiveness would be increased if we did. We feel that elimination of our drinking is but a beginning. A much more important demonstration of our principles lies before us in our respective homes, occupations and affairs. All of us spend much of our spare time in the sort of effort which we are going to describe. A few are fortunate enough to be so situated that they can give nearly all their time to the work.

If we keep on the way we are going there is little doubt that much good will result, but the surface of the problem would hardly be scratched. Those of us who live in large cities are overcome by the reflection that close by hundreds are dropping into oblivion every day. Many could recover if they had the opportunity we have enjoyed. How then shall we present that which has been so freely given us?

We have concluded to publish an anonymous volume setting forth the problem as we see it. We shall bring to the task our combined experience and knowledge. This should suggest a useful program for anyone concerned with a drinking problem.

Of necessity there will have to be discussion of matters medical, psychiatric, social, and religious. We are aware that these matters are from their very nature, controversial. Nothing would please us so much as to write a book which would contain no basis for contention or argument. We shall do our utmost to achieve that ideal. Most of us sense that real tolerance of other people's shortcomings and viewpoints and a respect for their opinions are attitudes which make us more useful to others. <span class="bg-direction">Our very lives, as ex-problem drinkers, depend upon our constant thought of others and how we may help meet their needs.</span>
</div>

### Understanding types of drinkers (PLBB)

<i>**Joe**: Let's go to page 20. It says
</i>

**Bill (read by Joe)**: You may already have asked yourself why it is that all of us became so very ill from drinking. Doubtless you are curious to discover how and why, in the face of expert opinion to the contrary, we have recovered from a hopeless condition of mind and body. If you are an alcoholic who wants to get over it, you may already be asking--"What do I have to do?"

**Bill (read by Joe)**: It is the purpose of this book to answer such questions specifically. 

<i>**Joe**: Remember last night we talked about precicely, specifically with clear cut directions, well here's one of those words.
</i>

**Bill (read by Joe)**: We shall tell you what we have done. Before going into a detailed discussion, it may be well to summarize some points as we see them.

**Bill (read by Joe)**: How many time people have said to us: "I can take it or leave it alone. Why can't he?" "Why don't you drink like a gentleman or quit?" "That fellow can't handle his liquor." "Why don't you try beer and wine?" "Lay off the hard stuff." "His will power must be weak." "He could stop if he wanted to." "She's such a sweet girl, I should think he'd stop for her sake." "The doctor told him that if he ever drank again it would kill him, but there he is all lit up again."

**Bill (read by Joe)**: Now these are commonplace observations on drinkers which we hear all the time. Back of them is a world of ignorance and misunderstanding. We see that these expressions refer to people whose reactions are very different from ours.

<i>**Charlie**: Now, we're going to look at two kinds of drinkers. That these expressions that Joe just read, would refer to them.
</i>

**Bill (read by Joe)**: Moderate drinkers have little trouble in giving up liquor entirely if they have good reason for it. They can take it or leave it alone.

<i>**Charlie**: Remember we talked about them last night, to have a couple of drinks, they get a slightly tipsy, out-of-control feeling, beginnings of a nauseous feeling? Alcohol is no big deal for them. If they have any problems with it, they simply leave it alone. Those expressions that Joe read would certainly refer to the moderate drinker.
</i>

**Bill (read by Joe)**: Then we have a certain type of hard drinker. He may have the habit badly enough to gradually impair him physically and mentally. It may cause him to die a few years before his time. If a sufficiently strong reason--ill health, falling in love, change of environment, or the warning of a doctor--becomes operative, this man can also stop or moderate, although he may find it difficult and troublesome and may even need medical attention.

<i>**Charlie**: Now, we call this type the heavy or hard drinker. They drink like we alcoholics drink, but they are not alcoholic. If a good enough reason presents itself to them, they'll do one of two things. They may learn to moderate their drinking. They do not have the physical allergy. They may quit drinking entirely and stay quit. They do not have the obsession of the mind. They drink like us, but they're not alcoholic. And you and I see them all of the time. They're the guys who said, when I was in the service, I was an alcoholic also, but when I got out of the service, I got married, went to church, quit drinking, don't see why in the hell you can't. No, they're not alcoholic. The expressions that Joe read in the beginning would refer to the heavy drinker. </i>

**Bill (read by Charlie)**: But what about the real alcoholic? He may start off as a moderate drinker; 

<i>**Charlie**: Which many of us did.
</i>

**Bill (read by Charlie)**: he may or may not become a continuous hard drinker; 

<i>**Charlie**: Some of us stay periodic.
</i>

**Bill (read by Charlie)**: but at some stage of his drinking career he begins to lose all control of his liquor consumption, once he starts to drink.

<i>**Charlie**: Now then we're going to describe the real alcoholic. And when you see the description in there that fits you, would you please raise your hand? We'd like to see if we're in a room full of real alcoholics.
</i>

<p class="text-muted">
**Bill (read by Joe)**: but at some stage of his drinking career he begins to lose all control of his liquor consumption, once he starts to drink.
</p>

<i>**Joe**: Charlie last night talked about crossing over that line. I don't know what line he was talking about, but I knew I was drunk when I went over it.
</i>

**Bill (read by Charlie)**: Here is a fellow who has been puzzling you, especially in his lack of control. He does absurd, incredible, tragic things while drinking. He is a real Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. He is seldom mildly intoxicated. He is always more or less insanely drunk. 

<i>**Charlie**: Anybody like that in here? You betcha!
</i>

**Bill (read by Joe)**: His disposition while drinking resembles his normal nature but little. 

<i>**Joe**: I always get good looking and out of debt as soon as I start drinking.
</i>

**Bill (read by Charlie)**: He may be one of the finest fellows in the world. Yet let him drink for a day, and he frequently becomes disgustingly, and even dangerously anti-social. 


<i>**Charlie**: Do we have any of those people in here?
</i>

**Bill (read by Joe)**: He has a positive genius for getting tight at exactly the wrong moment, particularly when some important decision must be made or engagement kept. 

<i>**Charlie**: Anybody like that in here? Always getting drunk at the wrong time. Now every holds there hand up on this one:
</i>

**Bill (read by Charlie)**: He is often perfectly sensible and well balanced concerning everything except liquor, but in that respect he is incredibly dishonest and selfish. He often possesses special abilities, skills, and aptitudes, and has a promising career ahead of him. 

<i>**Charlie**: Anybody like that in here? I've never heard anybody but an alcoholic say that though. I've never heard an Al-Anon say it yet.
</i>

**Bill (read by Joe)**: He uses his gifts to build up a bright outlook for his family and himself, and then pulls the structure down on his head by a senseless series of sprees. 

<i>**Charlie**: Anybody like that in here? 
</i>

**Bill (read by Joe)**: He is the fellow who goes to bed so intoxicated he ought to sleep the clock around. Yet early next morning he searches madly for the bottle he misplace the night before.

<i>**Charlie**: Any bottle hiders in here?
</i>

**Bill (read by Charlie)**: If he can afford it, he may have liquor concealed all over his house to be certain no one gets his entire supply away from him to throw down the wastepipe. 

<i>**Charlie**: Anybody spread them around wherever you might be?
</i>

<i>**Joe**: Phyllis and I used to buy a lug of whiskey, which is 3 5ths, one to share, and one to hide from each other.
</i>

**Bill (read by Charlie)**: As matters grow worse, he begins to use a combination of high-powered sedative and liquor to quiet his nerves so he can go to work. 

<i>**Charlie**: Anybody have to have a little something in the morning?
</i>

**Bill (read by Charlie)**: Then comes the day when he simply cannot make it and gets drunk all over again. Perhaps he goes to a doctor who gives him morphine or some sedative with which to taper off. Then he begins to appear at hospitals and sanitariums.

<i>**Joe**: Never did taper off. I always tapered on for some reason. I don't know.
</i>

**Bill (read by Charlie)**: This is by no means a comprehensive picture of the true alcoholic, as our behavior patterns vary. But this description should identify him roughly.

<i>**Charlie**: If our government is ever done anything right in the field of alcoholism, it's in education of the public about what alcoholism is, and what it isn't. Because of that a lot of the stigma has been removed from alcoholism. Many people are getting ?? today before they have to do everything here that describes the real alcoholic. But I guarentee you, if you're a real alcoholic, I think you found yourself in there somewhere. At least one of them are going to fit you. In my case practically every single one of them. One in particular 7 years after I got sober I sold a 40 acre, 45,000 broiler chicken operation. For years after that, every once in a while I would run into the guy bought it and sometimes he would wave and smile, and say, "Hey, Charlie" We have found another one. And he's refering to partially empty vodka bottles. Yeah. Behind corner posts, under rocks, hollowed trees, falling out of feed bins. Hell, he found them for years in there. Now here's the question.
</i>

### Why can't alcoholics just stop drinking? (PLBB)

**Bill (read by Charlie)**: Why does he behave like this? If hundreds of experiences have shown him that one drink means another debacle with all its attendant suffering and humiliation, why is it he takes that one drink? Why can't he stay on the water wagon? 

<i>**Charlie**: The moderate drinker can. The heavy drinker can. Why can't the alcoholic?
</i>

**Bill (read by Charlie)**: What has become of the common sense and will power that he still sometimes displays with respect to other matters?

**Bill (read by Charlie)**: Perhaps there never will be a full answer to these questions. Opinions vary considerably as to why the alcoholic reacts differently from normal people. We are not sure why, once a certain point is reached, little can be done for him. We cannot answer the riddle.

**Bill (read by Charlie)**: We know that while the alcoholic keeps away from drink, as he may do for months or years, he reacts much like other men. We are equally positive that once he takes any alcohol whatever into his system, something happens, both in the bodily and mental sense, which makes it virtually impossible for him to stop. The experience of any alcoholic will abundantly confirm this.

### The main problem (AR)

**Bill (read by Charlie)**: These observations would be academic and pointless if our friend never took the first drink, thereby setting the terrible cycle in motion. <u class="bg-warning">Therefore, the main problem of the alcoholic centers in his mind, rather than in his body.</u>

<i>**Joe**: Would you read that again please?
</i>

<p class="text-muted">
**Bill (read by Charlie)**: Therefore, the main problem of the alcoholic centers in his mind, rather than in his body.
</p>

<i>**Charlie**: Now, we must remember that always. Just before we take the first drink, we are stone cold sober. Or stark raving sober, one of the two. And the real problem centers in our mind, telling us we can drink, while sober, rather than in the body that ensures that we can't drink. Chances are you will never put your hand a hot stove again to see if it'll burn you a second time.</i>

<i>**Charlie**: I remember as a kid growing up, back in the depression years. There's a few of you in where who are old enough to remember that, too. Back in the 1930s we didn't have very much. We didn't have hot and cold running water. We didn't have forced air heat. Joe said his family was not so poor, they had to live in a tent, but he said By God if we had the money we would have lived in a tent, that's about how bad it was. But I remember in those days even though you didn't have anything you were very poor people. Clenliness was still next to Godliness.</i>

<i>**Charlie**: And every saturday night everybody in the family had to take a bath. Whether you needed a bath was besides the point, you still had to take one. And one night in the middle of winter, mother had heated the bath water on the old heating stove in the living room, put it in a number 3 washtub sitting behind that stove.</i>

<i>**Charlie**: Now every kid in the family takes a bath in the same water. I'm the baby of the family. By the time it got to me the crud would be an inch thick on it. Mother said "Get in there and get yourself clean." I thought to myself "How in the hell do I get clean there?", but I didn't dare say that to her. You didn't talk to your parents that way in 1930s. I scrapped the crud back, I got in the tub, began to wash myself. The heating stove is standing there, red hot. Somehow I managed to lean over and stick my rear against that hot stove. Burned a blister on my rear end about as big as my hand. Hurt me worse than anything that had ever hurt me before. And do you know I've never had an obsession of the mind to stick my ass on hot stove since then. I have never jerked my britches down, backed up to a stove, and said "Burn me again."</i>

<i>**Charlie**: Now alcohol has burned me over and over and over. Just as bad as that stove ever burned me, and for some strange reason my mind cannot remember that. Left on my own resources I start thinking about drinking, and after awhile what it's going to do for me. That great sense of ease and comfort. That great, exciting in-control feeling that comes from the first couple of drinks and my mind keys in on that. I forget about the jailhouse, the hospitals, and the divorce courts, and I don't see a thing in the world wrong taking a drink. And I take a drink, and I trigger the allergy, and I end up drunk. Over and over and over again. Last paragraph, page 24.

### Fallacious reasoning (AR)

<div class="text-muted">
If you ask him why he started on that last bender, the chances are he will offer you any one of a hundred alibis. Sometimes these excuses have a certain plausibility, but none of them really makes sense in the light of the havoc an alcoholic's drinking bout creates. They sound like the philosophy of the man who, having a headache, beats himself on the head with a hammer so that he can't feel the ache. If you draw this fallacious reasoning to the attention of an alcoholic, he will laugh it off, or become irritated and refuse to talk.
</div>

### Once in a while (AR)

<div class="text-muted">
Once in a while he may tell the truth. And the truth, strange to say, is usually that he has no more idea why he took that first drink than you have. Some drinkers have excuses with which they are satisfied part of the time. But in their hearts they really do not know why they do it. Once this malady has a real hold, they are a baffled lot. There is the obsession that somehow, someday, they will beat the game. But they often suspect they are down for the count.

How true this is, few realize. In a vague way their families and friends sense that these drinkers are abnormal, but everybody hopefully awaits the day when the sufferer will rouse himself from his lethargy and assert his power of will.

The tragic truth is that if the man be a real alcoholic, the happy day may not arrive. He has lost control. At a certain point in the drinking of every alcoholic, he passes into a state where the most powerful desire to stop drinking is of absolutely no avail. This tragic situation has already arrived in practically every case long before it is suspected.

<i class="bg-warning">The fact is that most alcoholics, for reasons yet obscure, have lost the power of choice in drink. Our so-called will power becomes practically nonexistent. We are unable, at certain times, to bring into our consciousness with sufficient force the memory of the suffering and humiliation of even a week or a month ago. We are without defense against the first drink.
</i>

The almost certain consequences that follow taking even a glass of beer do not crowd into the mind to deter us. If these thoughts occur, they are hazy and readily supplanted with the old threadbare idea that this time we shall handle ourselves like other people. There is a complete failure of the kind of defense that keeps one from putting his hand on a hot stove.

The alcoholic may say to himself in the most casual way, "It won't burn me this time, so here's how!" Or perhaps he doesn't think at all. How often have some of us begun to drink in this nonchalant way, and after the third or fourth, pounded on the bar and said to ourselves, "For God's sake, how did I ever get started again?" Only to have that thought supplanted by "Well, I'll stop with the sixth drink." Or "What's the use anyhow?"
</div>

### Beyond human aid (AR)

**Bill (read by Joe)**: When this sort of thinking is fully established in an individual with alcoholic tendencies, he has probably placed himself beyond human aid, and unless locked up, may die or go permanently insane. 

<i>**Charlie**: Now if we've placed ourself beyond human aid, then the fellowship of Alcoholics Anonymous will not bring about recovery. Because the fellowship is made up of a group of human beings who are just as powerless over alcohol as I am. So there's got to be a solution to that condition that we've just talked about. And page 25 gives it to us.
</i>

<p class="text-muted">
These stark and ugly facts have been confirmed by legions of alcoholics throughout history. But for the grace of God, there would have been thousands more convincing demonstrations. So many want to stop but cannot.
</p>

**Bill (read by Charlie)**: <u class="bg-promise">There is a solution.</u>

<i>**Charlie**: Let's go to page 25, let's look at the solution. We can see that the fellowship gave us enough power support us for awhile, but we were told that the fellowship alone is not sufficient. It explained why the fellowship alone is not sufficient. Now, on page 25 we'll start looking at the real solution to alcoholism.
</i>

### Alcoholism is a life and death situation (PLBB)

**Bill (read by Joe)**: <span class="text-muted">There is a solution.</span>

**Bill (read by Joe)**: Almost none of us liked the self-searching, the leveling of our pride, the confession of shortcomings which the process requires for its successful consummation. But we saw that it really worked in others, and we had come to believe in the hopelessness and futility of life as we had been living it. When, therefore, we were approached by those in whom the problem had been solved, there was nothing left for us but to pick up the simple kit of spiritual tools laid at out feet. <span class="bg-promise">We have found much of heaven and we have been rocketed into a fourth dimension of existence of which we had not even dreamed.</span>

**Bill (read by Joe)**: The great fact is just this, and nothing less: That we have had deep and effective spiritual experiences[^spiritual] which have revolutionized our whole attitude toward life, toward our fellows and toward God's universe. The central fact of our lives today is the absolute certainty that our Creator has entered into our hearts and lives in a way which is indeed miraculous. He has commenced to accomplish those things for us which we could never do by ourselves.

</i>

<i>**Charlie**: Must be important.
</i>

<i>**Joe**: It must be important, they repeat it 3 times. And they're talking about the spiritual experience here, and spiritual awakenings. And in the first printing of the book, they didn't have the little asterisk in the back. And it didn't have a reference to the Spiritual Experience in the back of the book. And a lot of people would write in to that little office, and say "Bill, what do you mean by spiritual experience and spiritual awakening?" We're doing the same things that you're doing, but we're not having the same experiences that you had. "What do you mean by that?" And it was very important for me, looking back at it, now that I know this, because I had this spiritual experience mixed up with a bunch of things I learned when I was 7 or 8 years old. Because when I was 7 or 8 years old I told myself. I said, Self, "if I ever get big enough that they can't catch me, I'm not going anymore, to church that is" and I got big enough that they couldn't catch me, and I didn't go. So when I arrived in A.A. I had the spiritual knowledge of a 7 or 8 year old boy, which is practically none. And that that I did have was all mistaken and mixed up, and lots of emotionalism, things I didn't understand. The times that they would catch me, take me to that revival, they had a revival there quite often in my area in the southern baptist. Really southern. And when I would get there and they would be preaching all day, singing songs, and having dinner on the ground, prayer meetings all day long, and church way into the night. Bored the heck out of me. But one night my aunt Mutch got into the spirit of this thing that night. She began to jump up and down, and she began to talk in a strange language that I never heard of before, squealing and hollering, rolling around in the sawdust. It scared the heck out of me. So when this book began to talk about spiritual experiences and spiritual awakenings, I thought that's what I was going to have to have. And I was dreading it. But thank God for people like me who didn't know any better. They put this information in the back of the book, talking about spiritual experience and spiritual awakening. These are used all throughout the book and they want to make real sure that I understand what they mean by that. So let's go back to page 569, and see what they mean by "spiritual awakening" and "spiritual experiences". So on page 569

### No middle-of-the-road (AR)

**Bill (read by Joe)**: If you are as seriously alcoholic as we were, we believe there is no middle-of-the-road solution. We were in a position where life was becoming impossible, and if we had passed into the region from which there is no return through human aid, we had but two alternatives: One was to go on to the bitter end, blotting out the consciousness of our intolerable situation as best we could; 

<i>**Charlie**: That's step 1, remaining powerless.
</i>

**Bill (read by Joe)**: and the other, to accept spiritual help. 

<i>**Charlie**: That's step 2, to accept the need for a power greater than we are.
</i>

**Bill (read by Joe)**: This we did because we honestly wanted to, and were willing to make the effort.

<i>**Charlie**: Now we saw where step 1 the physical allergy, the obsession of the mind. We saw where that came from. From Dr. Silkworth in New York city. Now you would think that the idea of the spiritual experience would have come to us from through religious people. Let's look on page 26, and let's see where this idea really did come from. And we're talking here about certain American business man. This is a fellow named Rowland Hazard. He was the one that stepped in between Ebby and the judge.
</i>

### Why alcoholics must connect with a Higher Power (PLBB)

**Bill (read by Charlie)**: A certain American business man had ability, good sense, and high character. For years he had floundered from one sanitarium to another. He had consulted the best known American psychiatrists. Then he had gone to Europe, placing himself in the care of a celebrated physician (the psychiatrist, Dr. Jung) who prescribed for him. Though experience had made him skeptical, he finished his treatment with unusual confidence. 

<i>**Charlie**: He didn't go there for a 28 day treatment program. He was with Dr. Jung for a full year. Dr. Jung psychoanalysed him one day a week for 52 weeks. 
</i>

**Bill (read by Charlie)**: His physical and mental condition were unusually good. Above all, he believed he had acquired such a profound knowledge of the inner workings of his mind and its hidden springs that relapse was unthinkable. Nevertheless, he was drunk in a short time. More baffling still, he could give himself no satisfactory explanation for his fall.

**Bill (read by Charlie)**: So he returned to this doctor, whom he admired, and asked him point-blank why he could not recover. He wished above all things to regain self-control. He seemed quite rational and well-balanced with respect to other problems. Yet he had no control whatever over alcohol. Why was this?

**Bill (read by Charlie)**: He begged the doctor to tell him the whole truth, and he got it. In the doctor's judgment he was utterly hopeless; he could never regain his position in society and he would have to place himself under lock and key or hire a bodyguard if he expected to live long. That was a great physician's opinion.

**Bill (read by Charlie)**: But this man still lives, and is a free man. He does not need a bodyguard nor is he confined. He can go anywhere on this earth where other from men may go without disaster, provided he remains willing to maintain a certain simple attitude.

**Bill (read by Charlie)**: Some or our alcoholic readers may think they can do without spiritual help. Let us tell you the rest of the conversation our friend had with his doctor.

**Dr. Silkworth (read by Charlie)**: The doctor said: "You have the mind of a chronic alcoholic. I have never seen one single case recover, where that state of mind existed to the extent that it does in you." Our friend felt as though the gates of hell had closed on him with a clang.

**Rowland (read by Charlie)**: He said to the doctor, "Is there no exception?"

**Dr. Silkworth (read by Charlie)**: "Yes," replied the doctor, "there is. Exceptions to cases such as yours have been occurring since early times. Here and there, once in a while, alcoholics have had what are called vital spiritual experiences. To me these occurrences are phenomena. They appear to be in the nature of huge emotional displacements and rearrangements. 

<i>**Joe**: Change
</i>

**Dr. Silkworth (read by Charlie)**: Ideas, emotions, and attitudes which were once the guiding forces of the lives of these men are suddenly cast to one side, 

<i>**Joe**: Change
</i>

and a completely new set of conceptions and motives begin to dominate them. 

<i>**Joe**: Change
</i>

In fact, I have been trying to produce some such emotional rearrangement within you. 

<i>**Joe**: Change
</i>

With many individuals the methods which I employed are successful, but I have never been successful with an alcoholic of your description."[^spiritual2]

[^spiritual2]: **Bill**: For amplification--see Appendix II.

<i>**Charlie**: Can you imagine this. This is the worlds 3rd most well known psychyatrist at that time. Dr. Sigmund Freud, Dr. Alfred Adler, and Dr. Carl Jung. Rowland goes to Dr. Jung and is treated for a year. Goes out and gets drunk and comes back. Begs the doctor to tell him the whole truth. And this doctor had enough humility to say Rowland, I've done all I can do for you. With my knowledge of the mind and my skills, I just can't help you anymore. You're probably going to die from alcoholism. He could have said, Rowland I think you're suffering from a bad Valium defficiency. Let me write you a prescription, you can come back for another year. He was a good enough man not to do that. And Rowland said 
</i>

<p class="text-muted">
**Rowland (read by Charlie)**: "Is there no exception?"
</p>

<i>And this guy was brave enough to go out of his field, and say "Oh, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah. Once in awhile I've seen people like you have a vital spiritual experience. I don't understand it. It's phenomena to me, but I have seen it happen."

Now they tell us that Rowland tried to get to Freud first. And Freud wasn't taking any more patients. He tried to get to Adler, and Adler was too busy. Jung was the third choice. Now Adler and Jung were both students of Freud. And Jung had fallen out with Adler on one thing only. Adler and Freud thought all answers would lie within the mind. Jung thought some people might be helped through spirituality. Thank God that Rowland didn't get to Freud or Adler, we'd be sitting around today psychoanalyzing ourselves, rather than depending upon spirituality. And unfortunately that's what we're doing in a lot of our A.A. meetings. Trying to psychoanalyze, rather than depend upon spirituality. And what blows my mind to think about is this. We Alcoholics, who are so proud of our 12 steps, and rightfully we should be, I think we need to stop once in awhile and remember where they came from. Step 1 came from a non-alcoholic neurologist in New York city named Dr. Silkworth. Step 2 came from a non-alcoholic psychiatrist on the other side of the world named Dr. Jung. The last 10 steps came from a group of people called the Oxford Group, who were non-alcoholic practicing 1st century Christianity to the best of their ability. Everything that you and I use for recovery came to us from non-alcoholics. I think we need to remember that, it might be good for our humility to do so. Joe?
</i>

<i>**Joe**: Is that odd, or is that God? I think about Dr. Silkworth, he knew what the problem was, he observed that through working with 50,000 of us alcoholics, and that became his oppinion. But he didn't have a solution for it. Dr. Jung had a solution to alcoholism, the vital spiritual experience, but he didn't know what the problem was. The Oxford Group had some tenants that we could work, they had the plan of a program of action, so to speak, but they weren't involved with the problem or the solution, either one.

Here's a wholesale miracle happened from that moment until this if you will. Prior to this he said that
</i>

<p class="text-muted">
**Dr. Silkworth (read by Joe)**: Exceptions to cases such as yours have been occurring since early times. Here and there, once in a while, alcoholics have had what are called vital spiritual experiences. To me these occurrences are phenomena. 
</p>

<i>**Joe**: He went back and joined the Oxford Group, and took the plan of a program of action and the tennants of the Oxford Group, and he recovered. And he was able to help Ebby, and Ebby brought this to Bill. And Bill was over there getting all of this other information. It gelled in the mind of Bill Wilson, one person. But the miracle is this. Back in those days it was just here and there, once in a great while. Today we can look around these rooms at each other and say to each other. Here and now, every time an alcoholic will apply these things to their life, they too can recover, and they call that Alcoholics Anonymous. A wholesale miracle has happened. I am not the miracle, the miracle is A.A. and I get to participate in it.
</i>

<i>**Charlie**: I can almost see Bill now, as he finishes up with Chapter 2. Probably sitting down reviewing what he's told us up until this point. Saying to himself that in the doctor's opinion and my story I was able to show them the problem, in chapter 2 I was able to show them the solution. Now let's look at a little picture for just a moment. That little picture we have up here on the screen, talking about what is the solution. On the left hand side of the picture we see the fellowship, which supports this, where the older members, through the sharing of their experience, strength and hope with the newcomer, provides enough support to the newcomer to be able to stay sober for a period of time, and by the way it's a two way street. As we older members support the new member, then we draw strength from that too. Great strength from the fellowship. It would be almost impossible to be in A.A. today for very long and not begin to believe there's some power greater than human power working within this thing. When you hear countless hundreds of people saying "It's only by the grace of God", or "Because of God as I understand Him", or "Because of the Power Greater than I am" I haven't found it necessary to take a drink. You can hardly hear that over and over and over. And not begin to believe there's some power working within this thing. The instant the newcomer begins to believe that, that opens the mind, and they become willing to investigate. And upon investigation we find that simple kit of spiritual tools right at our feet. The 12 steps of Alcoholics Anonymous.
</i>

As we work and apply those steps in our lives, we get a personality change sufficient to recover from Alcoholism, and we find the power greater than human power. When that happens to us we then have become older member of A.A. Now we can go back to the left-hand side of the sheet, and we can help support the next newcomer. Help them work their program, so they can have a spiritual experience also. The book plainly states you cannot give something away that you haven't got. Now somewhere down the line when they quit working the program out of the book, then in self-defence they started measuring success by how long have you been sober, rather than the quality of that sobriety. In the beginning, everybody was expected to work the program, have the spiritual experience, and if they didn't want to do that they were told, "You might as well leave here, because we can't help you if you don't do that." So older membership was based on quality of sobriety rather than quantity of sobriety. Today you see all kinds of people in A.A. You see somebody who has been here maybe 6 months, they've got a good sponsor, they got immediately into the program. They've worked the steps, they've had a spiritual awakening, they're always laughing, cutting up, having fun, always helping A.A. and doing what they can for other alcoholics, they are a delight to behold, and you just love to be around them. Only been sober 6 months. You've got other who have been in here 6, 8, 10 years. Treated it like a cafeteria, took some, but left what they didn't want. Now they're better than they used to be. But you never know what kind of shape they're going to be when you run into them. One day they're up, the next day they're down. They're kind of like a yo-yo going back and forth. Then you see some people who have been in there 15, 20 years. Never worked a step. Damn proud of it. And they're the ones who say, "By God, if you want what we've got, and you're willing to go to any DAMN lengths to get it." Some of those guys feel so bad you'd like to buy them a drink. You know they would feel better with a drink. So we're not talking about quantity of sobriety, here, we're talking about quality of sobriety. And only those who have had the spiritual experience can help another have the spiritual experience. You simply can't give away something that you don't have. I see Bill, running this all through his mind. And he says to himself "They're not going to like this idea of the spiritual experience anymore than I did" Remember he had an aversion to these things. He and Ebby argued about this for a long time. I think Bill says, "I need to tell them just exactly what's going to happen to them, if they don't have this spiritual experience." And he writes another chapter, and he called it "More about Alcoholism" In this chapter he talks about one thing and one thing only. He talks about the insanity of alcoholism.

### The terrible dilemma (AR)

<div class="text-muted">
Upon hearing this, our friend was somewhat relieved, for he reflected that, after all, he was a good church member. This hope, however, was destroyed by the doctor's telling him that while his religious convictions were very good, in his case they did not spell the necessary vital spiritual experience.

Here was the terrible dilemma in which our friend found himself when he had the extraordinary experience, which as we have already told you, made him a free man.
</div>

### God, as you understand God (PLBB)

<div class="text-muted">
We, in our turn, sought the same escape with all the desperation of drowning men. What seemed at first a flimsy reed, has proved to be the loving and powerful hand of God. A new life has been given us or, if you prefer, "a design for living" that really works.

The distinguished American psychologist, William James, in his book "Varieties of Religious Experience," indicates a multitude of ways in which men have discovered God. We have no desire to convince anyone that there is only one way by which faith can be acquired. If what we have learned and felt and seen means anything at all, it means that all of us, whatever our race, creed, or color are the children of a living Creator with whom we may form a relationship upon simple and understandable terms as soon as we are willing and honest enough to try. Those having religious affiliations will find here nothing disturbing to their beliefs or ceremonies. There is no friction among us over such matters.

We think it no concern of ours what religious bodies our members identify themselves with as individuals. This should be an entirely personal affair which each one decides for himself in the light of past associations, or his present choice. Not all of join religious bodies, but most of us favor such memberships.

In the following chapter, there appears an explanation of alcoholism, as we understand it, then a chapter addressed to the agnostic. Many who once were in this class are now among our members. Surprisingly enough, we find such convictions no great obstacle to a spiritual experience.

Further on, clear-cut directions are given showing how we recovered. These are followed by three dozen personal experiences.

Each individual, in the personal stories, describes in his own language and from his own point of view the way he established his relationship with God. These give a fair cross section of our membership and a clear-cut idea of what has actually happened in their lives.

We hope no one will consider these self-revealing accounts in bad taste. Our hope is that many alcoholic men and women, desperately in need, will see these pages, and we believe that it is only by fully disclosing ourselves and our problems that they will be persuaded to say, "Yes, I am one of them too; I must have this thing."

## Spiritual Experience 

**Bill (read by Joe)**: The terms "spiritual experience" and "spiritual awakening" are used many times in this book which, upon careful reading, 

<i>**Joe**: We all know alcoholics don't do "careful reading."
</i>

**Bill (read by Joe)**: shows that the personality change sufficient to bring about recovery from alcoholism has manifested itself among us in many different forms.

<i>**Charlie**: Okay, the first paragraph, we see something. We see that the term maybe spiritual experience or it may be spiritual awakening, and in either case it's going to be a personality change sufficient to bring about recovery. Dr. Silkworth referred to this as a psychic change. A change in the way we think and the way we feel, and our attitude. So we could see several terms, spiritual experience, spiritual awakening, personality change, or psychic change, all meaning the same thing.
</i>

<i>**Joe**: Spiritual experience happens suddenly, like it did with Bill, and some of the people in the stories in the first book. And then we have a spiritual awakening, which develops slowly over a period of a long time. 
</i>

**Bill (read by Joe)**: Yet it is true that our first printing gave many readers the impression that these personality changes, or religious experiences, must be in the nature of sudden and spectacular upheavals. Happily for everyone, this conclusion is erroneous.

**Bill (read by Joe)**: In the first few chapters a number of sudden revolutionary changes are described. Though it was not our intention to create such an impression, many alcoholics have nevertheless concluded that in order to recover they must acquire an immediate and overwhelming "God-consciousness" followed at once by a vast change in feeling and outlook.

**Bill (read by Joe)**: Among our rapidly growing membership of thousands of alcoholics such transformations, though frequent, are by no means the rule. Most of our experiences are what the psychologist William James calls the "educational variety" because they develop slowly over a period of time. 

<i>**Charlie**: Now Bill's was a sudden spectacular change. Some of the others in the stories in the back of the book were sudden spectacular changes, but with most of us it won't happen that way. Most of us will have the educational variety, and we will change, as we learn, and as we apply, slowly over a period of time. Sooner or later, though, we awaken to the fact that we have changed also. And then we'll call it a spiritual awakening. So it really doesn't make any difference whether it's sudden and spectacular, or whether it's a slow thing that evolves over a period of time, in either case it's going to be a personality change sufficient to bring about recovery. Now I can live with this kind of idea. But when you start talking what Mutch had in the baptist church. I couldn't live with that idea at all. Because I was raised in the southern baptist church, too. And my idea of a spiritual experience was an entirely different thing. Thank God for this Appendix that let me know what it really is--a change in my personality. My personality is made up of the way I think, the way I feel, my attitude and outlook upon life, perople, places and things, in general. That's what determines my personality. I come here restless, irritable and discontented. Filled with shame, fear, guilt, remorse. If I can change from that to peace of mind, serenity, and happiness, then I've undergone one hell of a change in my personality.
</i>

<i>**Joe**: It's the educational variety thats what we're having this weekend. Right? We won't be the same after this weekend. None of us will.
</i>

**Bill (read by Joe)**: Quite often friends of the newcomer are aware of the difference long before he is himself. He finally realizes that he has undergone a profound alteration in his reaction to life; that such a change could hardly have been brought about by himself alone. What often takes place in a few months could seldom have been accomplished by years of self discipline. With few exceptions our members find that they have tapped an unsuspected inner resource which they presently identify with their own conception of a Power greater than themselves.

**Bill (read by Joe)**: Most of us think this awareness of a Power greater than ourselves the essence of spiritual experience. Our more religious members call it "God-consciousness."

**Bill (read by Joe)**: Most emhpatically we wish to say that any alcoholic capable of honestly facing his problems in the light of our experience can recover provided he does not close his mind to all spiritual concepts. He can only be defeated by an attitude of intolerance or belligerent denial.

**Bill (read by Joe)**: We find that no one need have difficulty with the spiritual side of the program. Willingness, honesty and open mindedness are the essentials of recovery. But these are indispensable.

<blockquote>
**Herbert Spencer (read by Joe)**: "There is a principle which is a bar against all information, which is proof against all arguments and which cannot fail to keep a man in everlasting ignorance--that principle is contempt prior to investigation."
</blockquote>

<i>**Joe**: See, I knew so many things that were not true when I arrived in A.A. Life long theories that were not true. I was living my life based upon those things and they didn't work. And they were so true in my mind, that it was almost impossible for me to learn something that was true. So I've had to lay aside a bunch of old ideas to accept new ideas, and I needed an open mind. In fact I need an open mind more today than I've ever needed an open mind, because there's so much more to learn thoughout life.
</i>

<i>**Charlie**: Okay, now we pointed out the fact awhile ago that Bill loves to teach, by using examples of something we already know about to teach us something new. That's what he did when he used the great ocean liner. Another trend that Bill has, and I think it's very important for us to realize it. Like most writers, he did repeat himself quite often, but every time he repeated himself he would normally find a different word that means the same thing. And if you see what he's doing you can understand him. If you don't though, then you'll think he's talking about something different. There seems to be one key word in this whole thing dealing with spiritual experience, and that is the word "change." Let's see how many times he said change on page 569. and how many different ways he's saying it.
</i>

<i>**Charlie**: In the first paragraph he talks about a "personality change" sufficient to bring about recovery. In the second paragraph he again mentions "personality change" but then he said "in the nature of sudden and spectacular upheavals" An upheaval is to change something entirely. In the third paragraph, first sentance, he said "sudden revolutionary changes" to revolutionize something is to change it entirely. Third paragraph, last sentance he said "immediate and overwhelming God-consciousness" to overwhelm something is to change it entirely. Third paragraph last sentance he said "vast change in feeling and outlook" Forth paragraph, first sentence, he said, "such transformation" to transform is to change. Fourth paragraph, about the middle of it he said "profound alteration" to alter is to change. So the key thing here is to change from what we were when we came here to something entirely different up here in our minds. To go from restless, irritable, and discontented, selfish, self-centered human beings. To go from that to one who has peace of mind, serenity and happiness, and the willingness to help others is an entire change in the way we think. That's the spiritual experience. That's a spiritual awakening. That's a personality change sufficient to recover from alcoholism. That's a psychic change. Now I can buy into that. To go from what we were to something entirely different. Im the way we think. Religion has nothing to do with it at all. We make the change through spirituality. It seems as though that's the only real way that people change--is through spirituality.
</i>

<i>**Joe**: They talked about change, and I told you that when I got here I had become everything I detested in a human being. And I didn't like who I was, who I had become, or who I was. They talked about change, and I thought they said to become something that I'm not. So I looked around the fellowship of A.A. and I found me some heroes. Some people that I wanted to be like, we need those heroes in the beginning. I still need my heroes. Charlie was one of my heroes. So I set out to be exactly like Charlie. I didn't like me, so I wanted to be like Charlie. I almost made it. Thank God I din't. We only need one Charlie. But I tried to emulate and be exactly like him, because I didn't like me. And that's good I needed that. So the type of change I think they're talking about today, is to change from what I had become to that which God intended for me to be. And that'a a marvelous experience of A.A. And in life, just to become who you are, and what God intended for you to be, only. And there's only one of those. Thank, God.
