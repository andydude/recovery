<i>**Joe**: Back on page 45, he says the main object of this book was to enable me to find a power greater than myself which would solve my problem. And Bill is going to sit down here now and he's going to write some of the best spiritual information the world has ever seen--a little formula, or proposals, he called them: the 12 Steps of Alcoholics Anonymous. 
</i>

<i>**Joe**: I can just see Bill with the problem that he has. 
We've got Protestants in A.A. 
we've got Catholics in A.A., 
we've got Jewish people in A.A.,
we've got a sprinkling of Muslims in A.A., and 
we've got some Buddhists coming to A.A.
How are you going to write a set of steps or proposals that is not going to offend some of these people? Quite a chore for a guy like Bill--or anybody--to tell you the truth.
</i>

<i>**Joe**: The Oxford Groups were coming from 1st-century Christianity. They had those four absolutes, and they were really, really strong. They wouldn't give you any slack at all. They were more interested in the letter of the law rather than the spirit of the law. Bill was interested in the spirit of these things rather than in the letter of them. That's why it's a spiritual program. So he had one gigantic problem, to write these steps in such a manner that they wouldn't offend anybody, and he accomplished that through the 12 Steps of Alcoholics Anonymous.
</i>

<i>**Charlie**: These four absolutes that the Oxford Group had said you had to practice:

- Absolute **Love**,
- Absolute **Purity**,
- Absolute **Honesty**, 
- Absolute **Unselfishness**

And these alcoholics were having a hell of a time being absolute anything--except drunks. And they said, "Bill, we need to get rid of that kind of stuff." 
</i>

<i>**Charlie**: Also they had made their own little steps--6 of them--which came from the Oxford Group tenets. And Bill could see loopholes in these steps that the alcoholic mind was slipping through. He knew that they were going to have to have more strength, and he knew they were going to have to be expanded, but he didn't know how far. In trying to satisfy that bunch, in trying to satisfy people from all different religions, and in trying to satisfy those who didn't want God in here, Bill had a terrible time with it.
</i>

<i>**Charlie**: By that time, A.A. really divided up into, you might say, three factions. In Akron where Dr. Bob was, they didn't have any problem with God. Dr. Bob was a highly religious man. He used the Bible and he insisted that everybody he worked with use it too. God was no problem there.
</i>

<i>**Charlie**: But the New York City people were an entirely different breed of cat. They didn't want anything to do with God if they could avoid it. They would have preferred a book dealing with the mind rather than with spirituality, period.
</i>

<i>**Charlie**: And there was a third faction that said, "Well, let's talk about God, but let's not talk about Him too much. Let's come down somewhere in the middle of this thing."
</i>

<i>**Charlie**: So Bill is trying to satisfy them all. And he said he tried and he tried and he tried to get started on Chapter 5. This is going to be the directions on how to recover. And he said, "I simply could not do it."
</i>

<i>**Charlie**: One night while in bed, leaning against the headboard, pad and pencil in hand, trying to start Chapter 5, he said, "I finally just gave up. I put down the pad and the pencil. I prayed and asked God for direction. I meditated for 10 or 15 minutes. Then after a while I reached over and picked up the pad and pencil, and it felt as though the pencil had a mind of its own as it raced across the pages." In less than 30 minutes, he had written How it Works--one of the greatest pieces of spiritual information that the world has ever seen.
</i>

<i>**Charlie**: After he had written it, he went back and numbered these proposals and he found out there were 12. He didn't set out to write 12 he went back and numbered them, and there were 12 of them there.
</i>

<i>**Charlie**: Now, almost immediately after having done that, somebody knocked on the door. One of the guys in the New York City group had one of his sponsees with him. They knew that Bill stayed up late working on the book anyhow, so they had come by to see Bill on the way home. Bill could hardly wait to show this to an older member: "Look, Look, Look at the new 12 Steps!"
</i>

<i>**Charlie**: And the older member said "What in the Hell is this? We only had 10 commandments, and now you got 12? Six has been sufficient for everything up until now. I don't like it at all." And the fight was on. 
</i>

<i>**Charlie**: And they fought and they fought, and Lois finally came in and gave them a cup of coffee and settled them down. Then Bill presented this How It Works to the other members--and that's when the crap really hit the fan. Because they begin to say to Bill, 
</i>

- "This sounds too much like the Oxford Group absolutes. You're going to have to get some of that stuff out of there." 
- "Bill, you're trying to give directions to people, and you don't have the right to tell anybody what they have to do."
- and "Bill this", and "Bill that."

<i>**Charlie**: They almost destroyed not only the book project but also the fellowship in its entirety.
</i>

<i>**Charlie**: Now Joe is going to read How It Works from the original manuscript, which most of you have probably heard before. As he reads through there, I think you'll be able to see the differences between what Bill wrote that night and what the fellowship forced him to change in order to have what we have today. </i>

<i>**Charlie**: Let's go through it for just a moment, and see the differences.
</i>
 
<i>**Joe**: Can you imagine what kind of fights if you left here today, and went back to your group, you had 12 steps when you left, but now you have 24? There would be a little fighting going on, wouldn't there? That's what Bill was up to. This is How It Works original manuscript
</i>

<hr/>

**Bill (read by Joe)**: Rarely have we seen a person fail who has thoroughly followed our **directions**. 

<i>**Charlie**: Not our suggestions, our directions
</i>

**Bill (read by Joe)**: Those who do not recover are people who cannot or will not completely give themselves to this simple program, usually men and women who are constitutionally incapable of being honest with themselves. There are such unfortunates. They are not at fault; they seem to have been born that way. They are naturally incapable of grasping and developing a **way of life** which demands rigorous honesty. Their chances are less than average. There are those, too, who suffer from grave emotional and mental disorders, but many of them do recover if they have the capacity to be honest.

<p class="text-muted">**Big Book First Edition**: At some of these we balked. thought we could find an easier, softer way. But we could not.
</p>

**Bill (read by Joe)**: With all the earnestness at our command, we beg of you to be fearless and thorough from the very start. Some of us have tried to hold on to our old ideas and the result was nil until we let go absolutely.

**Bill (read by Joe)**: Remember that **you** are dealing with alcohol--cunning, baffling, powerful! Without help it is too much for us. But there is One who has all power--that One is God. **You** must find Him now!

### The Twelve Steps (PLBB)

**Bill (read by Joe)**: Here are the steps we took, which are suggested as **your** program of recovery:

<p class="text-muted">Here are the steps we took, which are suggested as a program of recovery:</p>

- We admitted we were powerless over alcohol-- that our lives had become unmanageable.

- <span class="text-muted">Sought through prayer and meditation to improve our conscious contact with God *as we understood him*, praying only for knowledge of His will for us and the power to carry that out.</span>
- Having had a spiritual **experience** as the result of this course of action, we tried to carry this message to others, especially alcoholics, and to practice these principles in all our affairs.
- <span class="text-muted">Having had a spiritual awakening as the result of these steps, we tried to carry this message to alcoholics, and to practice these principles in all our affairs.</span>



Many of us exclaimed, "What an order! I can't go through with it." Do not be discouraged. No one among us has been able to maintain anything like perfect adherence to these principles. We are not saints. The point is, that we are willing to grow along spiritual lines. The principles we have set down are guides to progress. We claim spiritual progress rather than spiritual perfection.

**Bill (read by Joe)**: Our description of the alcoholic

<i>**Charlie**: That's the Doctor's Opinion, Bill's Story, and some of Chapters 2 and 3.
</i>

**Bill (read by Joe)**: the chapter to the agnostic

<i>**Charlie**: Chapter 4
</i>

**Bill (read by Joe)**: and our personal adventure before and after 

<i>**Charlie**: Bill's Story and those in the back of the book.
</i>

**Bill (read by Joe)**: have been designed to **sell you** three pertinent ideas:

<i>**Joe**: Well, Bill was a salesman, you know
</i>

**Bill (read by Joe)**: (a) That you are alcoholic and cannot manage your own lives.

<i>**Charlie**: Step 1
</i>

**Bill (read by Joe)**: (b) That probably no human power can relieve your alcoholism.

<i>**Charlie**: Step 2
</i>

**Bill (read by Joe)**: (c) That God can and will.


<i>**Charlie**: The rest of Step 2
</i>

**Bill (read by Joe)**: Now if you are not convinced on these vital issues, you ought to re-read the book up until this point, or else just throw it away.


<i>**Joe**: So you can see that Bill's intention was not just a set of suggestions, he was going to give real direction on how to work the steps. And he's going to give us specifically, clear cut directions on how to do that, he was very adamant about it. But the crap hit the fan and they made an argument to make some changes in the original How it Works, and so today's How it Works that we have in the book and the changes were forced upon Bill. Bill said he would compromise with them in this area, but he made a deal with them, and I can imagine that all the arguments that they had up until this point. They were almost ready to disband, and ruin the little fellowship of Alcoholics Anonymous at that time. So Bill made a little compromise. He said "From now on, I'll make these changes, I will complete the rest of this book, or else you could do it." Well they didn't want to complete the rest of the book they wanted Bill to continue to do that, so they agreed to let Bill continue to write the rest of the book without much interference on their part.
</i>

<i>**Charlie**: You know, I can almost see old Bill. When he wrote this and gave it to them. And they began to fight and argue over it. They tell him he's going to have to change it. Remember Bill is stuborn and bull-headed, just like the rest of us. He said "No, I'm not going to change this" And they said "Bill, you are, don't you remember, it's not your book, it's our book. That's the deal that we made to begin with." He said "That doesn't make any difference. I'm not going to change this part of the book." And they said "Well, you are going to change it." He said "What you don't realize, is these aren't my words anyhow" He said "These are God's words, they came after prayer and meditation." They said "We don't give a damn whose words they are. Its our book, and you're going to change them." And finally, finally, Bill realized that if he didn't compromise, they would destroy this project, and maybe the whole fellowship. And there was a non-alcoholic psychiatrist around in those days, and he made some suggestions. He said why don't you change it from directions to suggestions. You'll still get your meaning accross, and probably more people would accept it. And he said "Where you're saying: you, you, you. He said Don't do that, change that to we. Say this is what we had to do. And you'll get your meaning accross, and more people would accept it." And he said, "Where you're saying must, must, change that to ought, ought. And it would be more acceptable. Bill very, very reluctantly made those changes.
</i>

<i>**Charlie**: Today we don't know, if they hadn't made the changes, if they left it like it was originally, maybe instead of 2 million worldwide, we might have 10 million. But also instead of 2 million worldwide, we might only have 10 thousand, who knows. Nobody knows, we just know that this is the history behind this particular part of the book. Bill was cunning, baffling, powerful, also. He said "Okay, I'm going to compromise with you, but you're going to have to compromise with me." And they said "Well, what do you want?" He said "I'm tired, I've fought with you all I'm going to fight. If you want me to finish the book, then you give me the authority to do so. And if you don't want to give me the authoriy, then you finish the book." Well they didn't want to give him that authority, but they didn't want to finish the book either. So they very reluctantly agreed to that. Now what Bill knew that they didn't know, is that two pages later, he's going to put "directions" and "you" and "must" right back in the book. He's had it in the book, all the way up to how it works. They jerked it out, and then he puts it back. And that ruins some of the continuity of the book. But now that we've seen what happened, it makes more sense. The other things that is so apparent is when he says, about the 3 pertinent ideas, if I can find it again, I don't trust my memory that good anymore. 
</i>

<div class="text-muted">
Our description of the alcoholic, 
the chapter to the agnostic,
and our personal adventures before and after have been designed to sell you 3 pertinent ideas
</div>

<i>**Charlie**: He's talking about the Doctors Opinion and the first 4 chapters, and the stories in the back of the book. And if we've been sold on those 3 pertinent ideas
</i>

- (a) that we were alcoholic and could not manage our own lives

<i>**Charlie**: then we're throught with step 1, if we come to believe
</i>

- (b) That probably no human power could have relieved our alcoholism
- (c) That God could and would if He were sought.

**Bill (read by Charlie)**: If **you are** convinced, WE WERE AT STEP THREE, 

<p class="text-muted">Being convinced, WE WERE AT STEP THREE, 
</p>

<i>**Charlie**: You see the falicy in trying to start sombody in chapter 5, is that it starts with step 3. And it's hard to start with step 3 unless you've got 1 and 2 behind you. People say "Well, how do you work steps 1 and 2?" And our answer is "Well, you don't." They are not working steps. There is no action involved here. These are conclusions of the mind we draw based upon information presented to us in the Doctors Opinion and the first 4 chapters. I've always been powerless over alcohol, and my life has been unmanagable because of it. I just did not know that nor did I know why until I read the Doctors Opinion and the first 4 chapters. There's always been a power greater than I am that can restore me to sanity. I just did not believe that he would, nor did I understand the insanity until I read the Doctors Opinion and the first 4 chapters. Now if I can say to myself today, "You, Betcha! I'm powerless over alcohol. My life is unmanagable" I'm through with step 1. If I can say to myself today, "I have come to believe there is a power greater than I am that can restore me to sanity." I'm through with step 2. And now then I'm ready to look at step 3. Now I might make a decision.
</i>

<p class="text-muted">
**Bill (read by Joe)**: Being convinced, WE WERE AT STEP THREE, 
</p>

<i>**Joe**: We haven't taken it yet, we're just there
</i>

which is that we decided to turn our will and our life over to God as we understood Him. Just what do we mean by that, and just what do we do?

<i>**Joe**: Well, that's a very good question isn't it? What does step 3 mean? Well we're going to make a decision, that's part of it, to do what? To turn our will, and what it our will? Our will is our thinking and our life is our actions. Make a decision to turn our will and our life over to the direction to God as we understand Him. Our will is our thinking, our life is our actions. And we're going to make a dicision to turn them over to God to manage our thinking, and direct our actions in step 3. Haven't done that yet, but getting willing to do that.
</i>

<i>**Charlie**: I've always heard people say the most misunderstood steps in the Big Book is Step 4. And I'll agree with that. But I don't think Step 4 is any more misunderstood than Step 3 is. 
</i>

<i>**Charlie**: 
I hear people today say, "I've been in A.A. about 5 years. My life is still all screwed up, and I don't understand why--because I turned it over to God 3 years ago when I took Step 3." </i>

<i>**Charlie**: 
No we don't turn anything over to God in Step 3. We make a decision to do something in Step 3. And the decision itself implies that we're going to have to take some further action to carry it out. </i>

<i>**Charlie**: 
One of the greatest examples I can think of is probably from 4, 5, 6 years ago now. Barbara and I made a decision to come to Los Angeles, California, and visit some of our relatives--but we didn't do anything to carry that decision out. And sure enough, we didn't get to Los Angeles that year either. </i>

<i>**Charlie**: 
Second year in a row, we made a decision to come to Los Angeles and visit our relatives. Again we didn't do anything to carry it out. We didn't get to California either. </i>

<i>**Charlie**: 
Third year in a row, we made that decision. Only this time, it was a little different. This time, I took the car down and had it serviced. Barbara packed the clothes and a little food, and we got in our car and we drove from our little home to Tulsa, OK. Then we drove to Oklahoma City. Then we drove to Amerillo, TX. Then we drove to Albequerque, NM. Then we drove to Flagstaff, AZ. Then we drove to Barstow, CA. Then we drove to San Bernidino. And then we drove to Los Angeles. </i>

<i>**Charlie**: 
And by God, one day we ended up visiting our relatives in Los Angeles--not because we made a decision, but because we took the action necessary to carry out that decision. </i>

<i>**Charlie**: 
Now, what it is that we are deciding to do? Well, we're making a decision to turn our will over to the care and direction of God as we understood Him. </i>

<i>**Charlie**: 
What is our will? Well, our will is nothing more than our thinking apparatus. Our will is nothing more than our mind. Our will is nothing more than this thing up here that tells us what to do and what not to do. </i>

<i>**Charlie**: 
A good example of the word "will" tying it together with "mind." Let's say some of us are approaching the end of our lives--which a few of us in here are. We've gathered up a few material things and we've become concerned about what's going to happen to them when we pass on. </i>

<i>**Charlie**: 
We'll go down and sit down with an attorney, and tell that attorney what we want done with these things. "I want this to be my spouse's. This is to go to my doughter's. This to be my son's," and etc. The attorney will take my thinking from my mind that day, write it down in legal terms on a piece of paper. I'll sign it, the attorney will sign it, and he'll put it in a safe. </i>

<i>**Charlie**: 
Now a year or two or three later, sure enough, I kick the bucket. My family like most of them--they're going to call the undertaker and say, "Come and get him," and put me in that cemetary as soon as they can. </i>

<i>**Charlie**: 
And a couple of days later, they all gather at the cemetary. They have me suspended over a hole in the ground. They're all standing around that hole. Somebody says a few words gives a little prayer.
</i>

<hr/>

<i>**Charlie**: And I hope it's somebody from A.A. that does it. </i>

<i>**Charlie**: 
And when the ceremony is over, they start dropping me down in that hole. And if my family is like the rest of them, they're not going wait until I get to the bottom of the hole. As soon as I start down they jump in the car and head for that attorney's office. </i>

<i>**Charlie**: 
That attorney gets out that piece of paper, which says my thinking from two or three years prior to that time--when I was sitting there in that office. We know they call that piece of paper a "Will." It's not by accident. Will, thinking, mind--are all synonymous. </i>

<i>**Charlie**: 
I'm making a decision to turn my thinking aparatus over to the care and direction of God as I understand Him. </i>

<i>**Charlie**: 
And what else am I deciding to turn over? Well I'm deciding to turn my life over to the care and direction of God as I understand Him. </i>

<i>**Charlie**: 
And what is my life? Well, my life is nothing more than my actions. What I am right now, as of this moment, is accumulating sum total of all the actions that I've taken throughout my entire lifetime. That's what has made me who I am today. </i>

<i>**Charlie**: 
All action is born in thought. Sometimes we react to a situation so fast we think we do it automatically--but we don't. I can't actually pick up this glass of water unless my mind tells my body to do so. So, if all action is born in thought, then it stands to reason that my life is going to be determined by how I think. </i>

<i>**Charlie**: 
If my thinking is okay, chances are my actions are going to be okay, and chances are my life is going to be okay too. If my thinking is lousy, chances are the actions that I take are going to be lousy--and chances are I'm going to have a fouled-up life, too. </i>

<i>**Charlie**: 
Now, when I got to this stage of my program, I went to my sponsor and I said, "I don't think I'm going to be able to take Step 3." </i>

<i>**Charlie**: 
And he said, "Why?" </i>

<i>**Charlie**: 
I said, "If I turn my will and my life over to the care of God as I understand Him, I have no idea what He would have me be. He may want me to be a missionary. And He may send me to China. And I sure as hell don't want to go there." </i>

<i>**Charlie**: 
He just laughed and said, "Lets look at it this way: at least it wouldn't be in the hands of an idiot." </i>

<i>**Charlie**: 
He said, "Let's look back through your lifetime. You've always been a selfish, self-centered, self-will human being. You've always done what you've wanted to do whenever you wanted to do it, and the hell with the rest of them. Isn't that right?" </i>

<i>**Charlie**: 
And I said, "Well, You know it is." </i>

<i>**Charlie**: 
He said, "The end result of that is that you almost destroyed your life. Just as importantly, you've almost destroyed the lives of those around you who care for you. Just think--if God can direct your thinking, it might become better. And if your thinking becomes better, then your actions and your life are going to become better. Just as importantly, the lives of those around you who care for you would probably become better too." </i>

<i>**Charlie**: 
Then he said, "Charlie, left on your own resources, you're always going to do the same things you've always done. You're going to remain restless, irritable, and discontented. You're going to stay filled with fear, shame, guilt, and remorse. Sooner or later, under those conditions, you're going to go back to drinking again. If you don't find some way to be sober and have a little peace of mind, serenity, and happiness, then you'll never have any long lasting sobriety. You can't do that on self-will." </i>

<i>**Charlie**: 
And he got it through to me in such a manner that I was able to make the decision to turn my will--which is my thinking aparatus--and my life--which is my actions--over to the care of God as I understand Him. </i>

<i>**Charlie**: 
Absolutely amazing what has taken place since that time.
</i>

<i>**Joe**: Forward to the first edition they say "precisely, specifically, with clear cut directions" And you know Bill wrote down those precise, specific, clear-cut directions in the original How It Works, but they forced him to change it. And when those changes come out, like how the book is now, those are the changes that were made, so it kind of alters the continuity of the book. Bill's directions were altered a little bit, but later on he puts them back in the book, as we see.
</i>

<i>**Charlie**: By the way, as far as we know, we are the only species on Earth, that's ever faced with this decision. It seems as though all the other species on Earth don't have self-will. Whatever they do at any given time, is always done on God's time at God's direction. It seems as though human beings are the only species that God gave this thing called self-will to. Therefore you see very few of the other species here on Earth in trouble. I've never seen a tree hit a car yet.
</i>

<i>**Joe**: One thing wrong with self-will is that everybody's got one. That's one of the things wrong with it. So the book says, and he gives us these little instructions here, and they're going to come short and sweet, and we're going to have be prepared to see them. He says
</i>

### Stop playing God (PLBB)

**Bill (read by Joe)**: The first requirement is that we be convinced that any life run on self-will can hardly be a success. On that basis we are almost always in collision with something or somebody, even though our motives are good. Most people try to live by self-propulsion. Each person is like an actor who wants to run the whole show; is forever trying to arrange the lights, the ballet, the scenery and the rest of the players in his own way. If his arrangements would only stay put, if only people would do as he wished, the show would be great. Everybody, including himself, would be pleased. Life would be wonderful. 

<div class="text-muted">
In trying to make these arrangements our actor may sometimes be quite virtuous. He may be kind, considerate, patient, generous; even modest and self-sacrificing. On the other hand, he may be mean, egotistical, selfish and dishonest. But, as with most humans, he is more likely to have varied traits.

What usually happens? The show doesn't come off very well. He begins to think life doesn't treat him right. He decides to exert himself more. He becomes, on the next occasion, still more demanding or gracious, as the case may be. Still the play does not suit him. Admitting he may be somewhat at fault, he is sure that other people are more to blame. He becomes angry, indignant, self-pitying. What is his basic trouble? Is he not really a self-seeker even when trying to be kind? Is he not a victim of the delusion that he can wrest satisfaction and happiness out of this world if he only manages well? Is it not evident to all the rest of the 'players that these are the things he wants? And do not his actions make each of them wish to retaliate, snatching all they can get out of the show? Is he not, even in his best moments, a producer of confusion rather than harmony?

Our actor is self-centered--ego-centric, as people like to call it nowadays. He is like the retired business man who lolls in the Florida sunshine in the winter complaining of the sad state of the nation; the minister who sighs over the sins of the twentieth century; politicians and reformers who are sure all would be Utopia if the rest of the world would only behave; the outlaw safe cracker who thinks society has wronged him; and the alcoholic who has lost all and is locked up.

<i>**Joe**: Wouldn't that be nice if everybody wouldn't mind? They won't mind it, but they just won't do it, because they have self-will. My will for my wife and my children is one thing. Their will and their life is another. They have a self-will, and their thoughts are different from mine. And most of the times they're in conflict. And they just won't mind me. I know they would be a lot better off if they would, but they won't. Now some 12 or 13 years after Bill wrote the Big Book, and after many, many years of some of the great teachers and minds in the world, and after many, many years with experience with us alcoholics, Bill was forced to write the 12 and 12. And he was really trying to push the Traditions on the fellowship. He was hard selling the Traditions, to the fellowship, but they weren't buying them, a lot of it. But they needed the Traditions, and he knew that. So he decided to write the Traditions. Well I'll put some short essays about the Steps, in with the Traditions, and maybe if they read the Steps, they will eventually read the Traditions. So he wrote the 12 and 12 for us. And the 12 and 12 again, is just short stories about the Steps, and it doesn't tell you how to work the Steps, just short stories about the Steps. The only piece of literature that tells you how to work the Steps is the Big Book of Alcoholics Anonymous. In the area of the 4th Step in the 12 and 12 there was some of the best information world's ever seen about self-will, and what makes people tick, and it's called the basic instincts of life. And I always suggest to people that I sponsor, that they go to the 12 and 12, read the first few pages about the basic instincts of life. Get a working knowledge about the words that you see in there. And then look them up in the dictionary, because they're very important words, and we're going to use them a little later on in the third column, when we're getting ready to do the 4th Step inventory. So I needed a working knowledge of that information, and Bill, in his usual manner wrote some of the best information about the basic instincts of life. Very, very important information.
</i>

<i>**Charlie**: I think we have to face the fact that in 1937, 38, 39, when Bill was writing the Big Book, he was not a spiritual giant. He was not a great student of human nature. Bill was a night school lawyer, a New York City stock speculator. 

Yet he was able to write one of the most spiritual books the world has ever seen dealing with human nature. Surely, surely, God took a hand in the writing of the Big Book. And used Bill's hand to write the book. 

By 1950, 51, 52, Bill knew a lot more about spirituality, a lot more about human nature, a lot more about we alcoholics than he did back in the 30s. He studied with some of the greatest minds for a period of years. And I think he felt that he had some new information that he could give us that would make it easier for us to work the steps according to the Big Book of Alcoholics Anonymous. 

Basically, that's what he says in the 12 and 12. That the Big Book was always the basic text, and always will be. You simply cannot work the program out of the 12 and 12. I see lots of people try it. But they can't do it because theres no directions on how to work the Steps. And I think that's why a lot of people love it. They can get in it and dance around and philosophise and never have to do anything except talk. 

There is some information in there that is absolutely invaluable and if we can see it and understand it and accept it, then it makes the working of the steps out of the Big Book so much simpler and so much easier. And these 3 basic instincts of life that Joe is talking about. He tought me in Step 4 in the 12 and 12 more about what makes me tick, and what makes me do the things I do, and act the way I act. He tought me more in 2 or 3 pages, than I had learn in some 40 years of living at that time. 

Let's look at them for just a moment. I think it will make it a lot easier to be able to see why we need to make our decision in 3 plus it sets us up with information for Step 4. 

Now in your handout sheets, you've got a little picture here about the middle in there somewhere, I think it's page 7 and 8 in your handout material. Which says the basic instincts of life which create self. All human beings are born with 3 basic instincts of life. They are God-given. They're absolutely necessary for the survival of the human race, therefore they are a good thing. 

### The social instinct (JC)

The first one he talked about was the social instinct. He said all human beings are born with a desire to be liked, to be accepted to be respected by other people. He said all human beings are born with a desire to come together in groups with other people. He said if we didn't have those desires and cared nothing for each other, that the world would go into complete anarchy, dog-eat-dog situation would reign. And eventually under those conditions the human race would fail to survive. 

Now he used several terms under the social instinct. He uses the term companionship, and that nothing more than wanting to belong and be accepted. So many of us grew up on the outside of the crowd, looking in, wanting to be and knew we could not be. 

He uses the term "prestige" that's wanting to be recognized as the leader of the group. And the world needs leaders. I guess back in the cave man days someone needed to say, "John, get back there behind that tree with your spear." "Jack, you get over there with your club." "Mary Joe and I will run this sucker through here." Somebody had to do that. 

Most people will take one of two directions, either let me be a part of, or let me be the leader of. In either case, it's based upon what other people think of us. 

Self-esteem is what we think of ourselves, which is either high or low based on what other people thing of us, or what we think other people think of us. If they seem to like us and accept us, we feel pretty good toward ourselves. If we feel like they reject us and don't want us then we feel pretty lousy toard ourselves. 

I got in the habit of going to the dictionary. I thought pride was something that you always ought to have. All I ever wanted to be as a young boy growing up. I wanted to grow up to be a man who walked tall with pride, and just a little bit sideways like John Wayne does. Until I looked it up in the dictionary, and it says that "pride" is an excessive and unjustified oppinion of one's self. 

We either think to highly of ourselves or to little of ourselves, and in either case not the truth. 

Personal relationships are our relationships with other human beings in the world around us. 

Ambitions are plans for the future. To be liked to be accepted, and so on and so forth. All human beings have these things.

Now if I want to be liked and accepted and respected by the world and the people in it the first thing I need to do is decide: What do they want from me? Society teaches us those things as we grow up. It will vary in different parts of the world. One part of the world, it might be, say, good education. In another part of the world it is to be a large land owner. In another part of the world it would be to have a large family. Any number of things, based upon where we live in the world. 

As we grow up and they teach us these things we set goals for ourself. As to what we want to become in the furute. And if want to reach those goals by ourselves, we just have to work at it. You can't just be a bumb and sit on your duff, and be successful, and people like you and accept you. 

If it's a good education, you're going to have to work at it, whatever it might be. I'm saying we're going to have to make some sacrifices there are some things that I would like to do as a human being which are very pleasurable and very exciting, but if you catch me at it, then you're not going to like me at all. 

And I don't think you and I would do the work necessary to reach the goal, or make the sacrifices necessary unless we get a reward for doing so. 

And the great reward, Bill said it in ??: "I had arrived" God how many of us have done it? 

We worked our tails off for years. And the day we reach the goal, and they pat us on the back, and they say "Joe, you're a fine fellow, you're a good man, you're doing great." A feeling comes over us which is one those indescribably wonderful feelings. Great, great feeling. 

The only thing wrong with it is that it seems to be a very temporary feeling. No sooner than we reach the goal we get the wreckage and we get the prestige from it and we look around and we say "Well, is this all there is to it?" And we set another goal. And we work and we work and we strive and we strive and we sacrifice, and we reach the new goal. And we get the praise and recognition feels great, doesn't last long and we set another goal. 

It seems to create within us human beings an insatiable desire for more and more power, more and more recognition, and we're not getting it fast enough, and they're not giving it to us in the way we thing they ought to, so what do we do about it? 

Well, we start taking short cuts. We start doing a little lying. A little coning. A little manipulating. A little stepping on other people's toes, and climbing on their backs, and the instant we do so create pain and suffering for others. They in turn retalliate against us and create pain and suffering for us. 

A life run on self-will can hardly ever be a success. Under those conditions, we will always be in collision with people places and things.

### The security instinct (JC)

Second basic instinct is the security instinct. I know in A.A. we try to live one day at a time. But I also know that just about everyone in this room as an insurance policy. The purpose of the insurance policy is to protect ourselves in the future. 

Bill says all human beings are born with a desire to be secure in the future. He said if we didn't have that desire we wouldn't provide the the food, the shelter we need to survive. And next winter we would simply freeze to death, or the next drought season we would starve to death. 

So this desire that we have to be secure in the future is a God-given thing and it is necessary for our survival. 

And once again if you're going to be secure in the future, you have to decide what you need to be secure. Society usually teaches us those things as we grow up, and it varies in different parts of the world. One part of the world, you only need $4. In another part of the world, you need $4,000. In another part of the world maybe you need $4 million. In another part of the world you need 198 coconuts. Whatever it is that they use to measure trade and barter with. 

Based upon what we're tought, we set goals for ourselves. And we begin to work at it. Now if you're going to be secure in the future, you can't just sit on your duff and be a bum, youre going to have to work, you're going to have to make some money, you're going to have to invest it. At the same time you're going to have to sacrifice. Hell we can't blow it all today and be secure tomorrow. 

And I don't think you and I would do the work necessary to reach the goal to make the sacrifices necessary if we didn't get a reward for it. Once again the great reward is that great feeling that comes at the successful completion of the goal. 

How many of us have done it? We set the goal for the new dress, for the new shoes, for the new suit, the new drapes, for the new couch, for the new home, for the new car, for the new piece of property, for the new business, and we work and we strive, and the day that sucker is paid for and nobody can take it away from us. What a great, great feeling that is. 

Back when I was a kid, almost nobody owned their own home. Once in a great while somebody would buy a home, and they would sacrifice everything they had to pay that sucker off. And the day they paid it off, the feeling was so great, they would call in the neighbors, and we would have a great party and celebrate it by burning the mortgage. How great that was! 

The only thing wrong with it is that it was just a temporary feeling. No sooner do I have my mortgage paid off, and I looked around and his house is bigger than mine. Yeah and he's driving a Cadillac and I'm driving a Chevrolet. And he's got a Brooks Brothers suit and I bought mine at K-mart. And that causes us to set another goal. And we work and we work and we strive and we strive we reach the new goal, which doesn't last long, so it seems to create an insatiable desire for more and more. And we're not getting it fast enough, and they're not giving it to us like we think they should, so what do we do? We take short cuts, we lie, we cheat, we con, we manipulate. And the instant we do, we've hurt other people. They retaliate against us, which creates pain and suffering for us. Plain life run on self-will can hardly ever be a success.

Third basic instinct he talks about is the sex instinct. He said all human beings are born with a desire to have sex. It may get turned off by bad teachings or bad happenings, but all human beings are born with a desire to have sex, because if we don't have sex, we can't reproduce ourselves. And if we don't reproduce ourselves, then sooner or later, the human race is going to fail to survive. So just like the other two, if your going to reproduce yourself through the sexual act, then you're going to have to work at it. Hell you can do more work in 3 minutes of sex if you can last that long than you will do all day digging a ditch. Don't you older fellows remember how it used to be when we got through with it. My God you just fall over sideways the sweat is just pouring up, to get your breath, you feel like you've died, and gone to heaven and come back 2 or 3 times.
</i>

<i>**Joe**: Gets excited doesn't it?
</i>

<i>**Charlie**: And I don't think you and I would do that kind of work if we didn't get a reward for doing so. And the great reward is that great feeling we get both physically and emotionally at the moment of sucessful completion of the sex act. One of the greatest rewards that a human being can experience. But also just like the other two it seems to be just a temporary feeling. Hell you no sooner get through with doing it then you get to thinking about doing it again. It's such a pleasurable and exciting thing, the next thing you know you get to thinking about doing it in different ways. Then you get to thinking about doing it in different positions. Then you get to thinking about doing it with different people. Next thing you know we're doing it at the wrong time in the wrong way with the wrong people and the instant we do so we create pain and suffering for others. They in turn retalliate against us, which creates pain and suffering for us. Yeah it's plain that a life run on self-will can hardly ever be a success. The fulfillment of these things are so pleasurable that all human beings from time to time will over do in one or more of these areas, and create pain and suffering for others. If you'll notice on that little chart. There's circle called self. That's where self-will comes from. From these 3 basic instincts of life. You'll also notice coming out of the self circle there's one called wrongs, which is another word we need to look at. Somewhere we got the idea that wrongs meant a list of dirty filthy nasty items. But if you go to the dictionary and look it up, you'll find several definitions of it. One definition of the word "wrong" is incorrect judgement of other people. A little later on we're going to find out that's exactly what a resentment is. Another definition of the word "wrong" is incorrect believing. A little later on we're going to find our that's what most of our fears are. Another definition of the word "wrong" are the harms and the hurts that we do to other people. Now it's easy to spot a selfish self-centered human being one who's running on self-will, not running on God's will. A selfish self-centered human being is always madder than hell. Damn him. Damn her. By God I'll show them. They're not going to treat me that way. Bla bla bla. A selfish self-centered human being is always scared to death. Can't depend on God. Can't depend on other people. And if we're an alcoholic reaching the end of the rope, we can't depend on ourselves any longer, and we're running absolutely scared to death all of the time. Selfish self-centered human being in order to fulfill the basic instincts of life are always overdoing and creating harms and hurts for others then we gotta be scared to death of what are they going to do when they catch us. And even if they don't catch us if God dwells in each of us we know the difference between right and wrong and guilt and remorse, associated with those things begin to eat us up. Now a person whose mind is filled with resentment, a person whose mind is filled with fear, a person whose mind is filled with guilt and remorse does not feel good. And eventually searching for a way to feel better we begin to think of the sense of ease and comfort that comes at once by taking a couple of drinks. Next thing you know we believe we can drink and we end up drunk all over again. So at the very least we're going to have to do something about this selfish self-centered human being and it seems the only way you can do anything about that is through God's help because God made self-will. And only God has the power to overcome that. At the very least we're going to have to do something about these resentments, and these fears, and these guilt and remorse in orderr to find the piece of mind serenity and happiness for good long term sobriety. If every human being in the world today could fulfill these three basic instincts at the level that God intends there would be no conflict on Earth today. But all human beings have self-will. All human beings from time to time will overdo in one or more areas, creating conflict for others and for themselves. I never knew that. I just knew I was always in trouble. I just knew that I was always madder than hell. I just knew I was always scared to death. I knew guilt and remorse was eating me up, but I didn't know where it came from. You see they gave me the rules, but they never tought me how to play the game. A.A. has tought me how to play the game. And now that I know how to play the game, I don't break the rules any more, and I don't hurt other people, and I'm not scared to death, and I'm not filled with guilt and remorse. This is the greatest information I have ever seen about what makes me tick. And what causes me to do the things that I do. Joe?
</i>

<i>**Joe**: Page 62
</i>

**Bill (read by Joe)**: Whatever our protestations, are not most of us concerned with ourselves, our resentments, or our self-pity?

<i>**Joe**: And it's not that I thought to well of myself, I thought to little of myself. I thought of myself only. That was my problem.
</i>

### How selfishness hurts us (PLBB)

**Bill (read by Joe)**: Selfishness--self-centeredness! That, we think, is the root of our troubles. Driven by a hundred forms of fear, self-delusion, self-seeking, and self-pity, we step on the toes of our fellows and they retaliate. Sometimes they hurt us, seemingly without provocation, but we invariably find that at some time in the past we have made decisions based on self which later placed us in a position to be hurt.

<i>**Joe**: Alcoholism, I, myself, and me. If you don't have a God in your life, and I didn't, then there's only one thing left to live by and that's satisfaction of these basic instincts of life. And I tried to live my life based on satisfaction of those basic instincts and I overdid in many of those areas.
</i>

**Bill (read by Joe)**: So our troubles, we think, are basically of our own making. They arise out of ourselves, and the alcoholic is an extreme example of self-will run riot, though he usually doesn't think so. Above everything, we alcoholics must be rid of this selfishness. We must, or it kill us! God makes that possible. 

<i>**Joe**: Can't heal a sick mind with a sick mind. Only God makes that possible.
</i>

**Bill (read by Joe)**: And there often seems no way of entirely getting rid of self without His aid. Many of us had moral and philosophical convictions galore, but we could not live up to them even though we would have liked to. Neither could we reduce our self-centeredness much by wishing or trying on our own power. We had to have God's help.

**Bill (read by Joe)**: This is the how and the why of it. 

<i>**Joe**: So he told us how it works, then he told us why it won't work because of our selfishness and self-centeredness, and now he's going to tell us how it really works.
</i>

<p class="text-muted">**Bill (read by Joe)**: This is the how and the why of it. 
</p>

**Bill (read by Joe)**: First of all, we had to quit playing God. It didn't work. 

<i>**Charlie**: Everything I read leads me to believe that this is a God directed world. Now if it is a God directed world and those of us who have been self directed and those of us who tried to direct everything and everybody around us we've been trying to do God's job for us. But we're not God, we just been playing at being God. And the book says we're going to have to quit doing that. If we want any peace of mind, serenity and happiness in the future. I think one of the great mistakes I see today in A.A. is people trying to force themselves to be better. And self-will cannot overcome self-will only God can overcome self-will. And if we want peace of mind, serenity and happiness, it looks like we're going to have to turn to God and let Him be the director, which is direction.
</i>

**Bill (read by Joe)**: Next, we decided that hereafter in this drama of life, God was going to be our Director. 

<i>**Charlie**: Not our suggestor, our director. He's got his word back, from here on it'll be "directions."
</i>

**Bill (read by Joe)**: He is the Principal; we are His agents. He is the Father, and we are His children. Most Good ideas are simple, and this concept was the keystone of the new and triumphant arch through which we passed to freedom.

<i>**Joe**: And what is that idea, this concept that
</i>

<p class="text-muted">**Bill (read by Joe)**: He is the Principal; we are His agents. He is the Father, and we are His children. 
</p>

<i>**Joe**: He is the boss, I work for Him. Now when I first got into this area of the 3rd Step I used God like you would an errand boy. I said "God, please help me to stay sober, and by the way, whie you're at it, help me to get my wife back."
</i>

<i>**Charlie**: Which one?
</i>

<i>**Joe**: The second one. I didn't want the first one back. That first one didn't drink. She was mean and ugly. I like the one that drank. Where was I, Charlie?
</i>

<i>**Charlie**: "God, give me a job."
</i>

<i>**Joe**: "God, give me a job, and by the way pick up a little extra money for me I need some money." I used God like you would an errand boy. Send him out like that. And after I got sober, I started reading that other book. That other Big Big Book and in the front of that book there's a story. They said He worked for six days, and then He rested. To my knowledge, he didn't have to go back to work anymore. So it looks like the only work being done around here is me doing the work.
</i>

<p class="text-muted">**Bill (read by Joe)**: He is the Principal; we are His agents. He is the Father, and we are His children. 
</p>

<i>**Joe**: He's the boss, I'm the employee.
</i>

<p class="text-muted">**Bill (read by Joe)**: Most Good ideas are simple, and this concept was the keystone of the new and triumphant arch through which we passed to freedom.
</p>

<i>**Charlie**: Now, he's referring again to that wonderfully effective spiritual structure.

- Step 1, willingness was the foundation,
- Step 2. believing was the cornerstone,

Now he tells us what we're building.
</i>

<p class="text-muted">**Bill (read by Charlie)**: a triumphant arch through which we passed to freedom.
</p>

<i>**Charlie**: And he said the keystone of that arch is the simple little idea that we're going to let God be the Director. You know in the old, old days when they built arches, the stones were all stacked loosely without mortar, and they began to lean together and there was a center stone up there called the "keystone." If it was cut right, then it would support the entire arch, but if it wasn't then it would slip out and the arch would collapse. What
</i>

<p class="text-muted">**Bill (read by Charlie)**: the keystone of the new and triumphant arch through which we passed to freedom
</p>

<i>**Charlie**: is this simple little idea. That we're going to let God be the Director. Now for most of us that's the first time we've ever had that idea or if we once had it as children we lost it somewhere and instead of letting God be the Director we were the Director, because we told God what we wanted. God do this, God do that, God give me this, God give me that, God if you do that for me I'll do that for you. And not only did we direct God we directed everybody around us. Well we're going to quit doing that. We're going to let God be the boss, from this day on. Now that is a radical idea for people like us. This is the decision that we're making.
</i>

<hr/>

<i>**Joe**: Page 63 says
</i>

**Bill (read by Joe)**: When we sincerely took such a position, all sorts of remarkable things followed. We had a new Employer. Being all powerful, He provided what we needed, if we kept close to Him and performed His work well. 

<i>**Joe**: He's not going to do my work well, I'm going to do his work well.
</i>

**Bill (read by Joe)**: Established on such a footing we became less and less interested in ourselves, our little plans and designs. More and more we became interested in seeing what we could contribute to life. 

<i>**Joe**: You see I was always a taker, and takers are losers in life, contributors are those that win, I've noticed.
</i>

**Bill (read by Joe)**: As we felt new power flow in, as we enjoyed peace of mind, as we discovered we could face life successfully, as we became conscious of His presence, we began to lose our fear of today, tomorrow or the hereafter. We were reborn.

<i>**Joe**: You know they used to come over to my house on Monday nights in that little church 2 blocks from my house and these guys wanted to talk to me about being reborn. And you know what I'm thinking? It's Monday night football. They want to talk to me about being reborn, and so I would run them off. "You guys get out of here. It's Monday night football! I don't want to talk to you, Get!" And that's the way I did with those guys, and I didn't understand this "reborn" back then at all. And I got to reading in that other book as I got sober, theres a story in there this guy's name is Nicodemus. And Nicodemus was about like me just done with this stuff. And he said "What do you mean by being rebord, do you mean I've got to go back into my mother's woom?" and he looked at him and shook his head, and said "Nicodemus, don't you know you can't do that? Didn't you go to the university? Aren't you educated? You can't do that. When I'm talking about being reborn, I'm talking about the renewing of your mind. Old ideas cast aside, new ones accepted. Reborn in my mind." I understood that then, and I'm ready to do business. I'm ready to do the 3rd Step. And I knew what they did on Sunday morning at that little church up there, about 11 o'clock I couldn't wait until I got there. I waited until next Sunday, well I didn't want to get there too early, I might hear something that would help me. So I got there about 3 or 4 mintues to 11, and sure enough they asked people to do that, and I came down there and I did this. They said
</i>

**Bill (read by Joe)**: We were now at Step Three. Many of us said to our Maker, AS WE UNDERSTOOD HIM: "God, I offer myself to Thee--to build with me and to do with me as Thou wilt. Relieve me of the bondage of self, that I may better do Thy will. Take away my difficulties, that victory over them may bear witness to those I would help of Thy Power, Thy Love, and Thy Way of life. May I do Thy will always!" We thought well before taking this step making sure we were ready; that we could at last abandon ourselves utterly to Him.

<i>**Joe**: And I don't know what happened that particular morning but I do know this. From that Sunday morning until this moment, my life hasn't been the same. It's like I've been walking on the dark side of the street all those years. And all of a sudden I'm on the sunny side of the street. And I don't know what happened. Except I do know that my life has changed. Thank God.
</i>

**Bill (read by Charlie)**: We thought well before taking this step making sure we were ready; that we could at last abandon ourselves utterly to Him.

<i>**Charlie**: Now, I think the word utterly means completely, wholeheartedly, all the way, the entire ball of wax. I hope you don't make the mistake I did first time I took step 3 I got on my knees, which I very seldom did in those days. I said
</i>

**Bill (read by Charlie)**: "God, I offer myself to Thee--to build with me and to do with me as Thou wilt. Relieve me of the bondage of self, that I may better do Thy will. Take away my difficulties,

<i>**Charlie**: and so on and so forth, and as I finished it up I said, "Now this applies to my alcohol. Don't fool with my sex life. Stay out of my money, I can handle that too."
</i>

<i>**Joe**: God said, "What an order, I can't go through with it!"
</i>

<i>**Charlie**: I said, "You take the alcohol and I'll take care of the rest." Well today I realize the falicy in that as far as I know he doesn't even drink. You know, He don't want the alcohol, he wants me, and he wants all of me. Just think if God can direct my thinking in all areas, it might even become better in my sex life. It might even become better in my money areas. It might even become better in all areas. And if my thinking becomes better in all areas, then surely my life will become better in all areas too. I think we really need to realize this is the decision that we're making. To turn our entire will and our entire life under the care and direction of God as we understand Him.

**Bill (read by Charlie)**: We found it very desirable to take this spiritual step with an understanding person, such as our wife, best friend, or spiritual adviser. 

<i>**Charlie**: Back in the beginning, there was never any question about this. The new person was expected to take this step in the company of other human beings. The first step in the Oxford Group Tenets was surrender. And when the new person got ready to surrender they would take them upstairs in Dr. Bob's house 3 or 4 of the older members would get down on their knees, and the new person would make their surrender. And after he was through, the older members would vote on how well he surrendered. If he didn't do it good enough, he'd probably have to do it again later on. I think there is a valid reason behind this. I'm told we alcoholics are born to live in 3 dimensions. We're born to be ourselves, and with our fellow human beings. If we are praying with other human beings for the first time. We're beginning to fit ourselves back together in all 3D the way God intended in the first place. We alcoholics are the funniest people in the world. We will let our families see us on our knees in the bathroom, hugging the porcelin bowl, puking our guts out, morning after morning after morning. We come to A.A. and we try to straighten out our lives, and we're ashamed and embarrased to let people see us pray. Isn't that something? Praying in the company of other human beings is always better. Anybody that I've worked with that I sponsor, I require that they take step 3 with me. First reason, if they take it with me, then I know they have taken it. That's the only way I know for sure. Second reason is when we do it together, it means more to me, and it has more strength and more power for myself. Let's take about a 15 minute break. And then we're going to jump into Step Four.

But it is better to meet God alone than with one who might misunderstand. The wording was, of course, quite optional so long as we expressed the idea, voicing it without reservation. This was only a beginning, though if honestly and humbly made, an effect, sometimes a very great one, was felt at once.
