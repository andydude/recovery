<i>**Joe**: Thank you everyone, my name is Joe and I'm an alcoholic.
</i>

<i>**Everyone**: Hi, Joe!
</i>

<i>**Joe**: It is truly by God's grace and the fellowship of Alcoholics Anonymous and the program of Alcoholics Anonymous, that I found in a book called Alcoholics Anonymous. I'm sober today, and for that I'm very thankful.
</i>

<i>**Charlie**: Hi everybody, my name is Charlie P. and I'm very greatful recovering alcoholic.
</i>

<i>**Everyone**: Hi, Charlie!
</i>

<i>**Charlie**: Because I'm a member of the fellowship of Alcoholics Anonymous, and by the grace of the power that I found in the 12-step program of Alcoholics Anonymous, and found this so take a drink for 10,516 days today, one day at a time. And for this I'm greatful. It's great to be here. Joe leaned over awhile ago, and he said, Charlie, this is one of the finest looking bunches of sick people we've seen in a long time. We always like to say as we start one of these things that we do not consider ourselves to be the gurus of the Big Book of Alcoholics Anonymous. We don't consider ourselves to be the experts on anything at all. We're just two old drunks that met together several years ago. Found that we had a mutual interest in the Big Book. We studied it together for quite some time. Hopefully, we've learned a few things about it. And those few things we've learned about it. We just love to be able to share them with other people. We do not attempt to speak for A.A. as a whole and you are most certainly free to agree or disagree with anything that we say throughout the entire weekend as you see fit. In fact if you hear us saying things that can't be reconciled with what's in the Big Book Alcoholics Anonymous, we suggest that you just don't pay any attention to those things. And we'll do our best to keep most of our conversation centered on the book itself. If we're going to study the Big Book of A.A. which of course that's what we're here for this weekend. I think it would be well if we would go back and look at just a little bit of the history behind the book. Be able to see what happened to some of the first people that put this thing together. And by looking at that history, it's going to make it a lot easier to understand the book itself as we go through that. What we like to do to look at some of the history is go to the forward to the second edition. Roman numeral 15. We'll start with the last paragraph on that page so everybody who has their books, you're ready. Roman numeral 15 and the last paragraph on that page.

<i>**Joe**: One of the things that's helped me over the years of studying in Bill's writings he does this and most of all of his writings if you kind of follow along with what he does and can help you understand some of his writings. For instance he'll always tell us what the problem is then he'll just tell us the solution to that problem. And then he'll give us a practical program of action to implement the solution that he just described. He does that in most all cases in his writing so that kind of helped me in understanding how Bill writes. So the bottom of roman numeral page 15. He said
