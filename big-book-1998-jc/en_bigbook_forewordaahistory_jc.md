<i>**Joe**: Thank you everyone, my name is Joe and I'm an alcoholic.
</i>

<i>**Everyone**: Hi, Joe!
</i>

<i>**Joe**: It is truly by God's grace and the fellowship of Alcoholics Anonymous and the program of Alcoholics Anonymous, that I found in a book called Alcoholics Anonymous. I'm sober today, and for that I'm very thankful.
</i>

<i>**Charlie**: Hi everybody, my name is Charlie P. and I'm very greatful recovering alcoholic.
</i>

<i>**Everyone**: Hi, Charlie!
</i>

<i>**Charlie**: Because I'm a member of the fellowship of Alcoholics Anonymous, and by the grace of the Power that I found in the 12-step program of Alcoholics Anonymous, and found it necessary take a drink for 10,516 days today, one day at a time. And for this I'm greatful. It's great to be here. Joe leaned over awhile ago, and he said, Charlie, this is one of the finest looking bunches of sick people we've seen in a long time. We always like to say as we start one of these things that we do not consider ourselves to be the gurus of the Big Book of Alcoholics Anonymous. We don't consider ourselves to be the experts on anything at all. We're just two old drunks that met together several years ago. Found that we had a mutual interest in the Big Book. We studied it together for quite some time. Hopefully, we've learned a few things about it. And those few things we've learned about it. We just love to be able to share them with other people. We do not attempt to speak for A.A. as a whole and you are most certainly free to agree or disagree with anything that we say throughout the entire weekend as you see fit. In fact if you hear us saying things that can't be reconciled with what's in the Big Book Alcoholics Anonymous, we suggest that you just don't pay any attention to those things. And we'll do our best to keep most of our conversation centered on the book itself.
</i>

<i>**Charlie**: If we're going to study the Big Book of Alcoholics Anonymous, which of course that's what we're here for this weekend, I think it would be well if we would go back and look at just a little bit of the history behind the book--be able to see what happened to some of the first people that put this thing together. And by looking at that history, it's going to make it a lot easier to understand the book itself as we go through that. What we like to do to look at some of the history is go to the Forward to the 2nd Edition, Roman numeral xv. We'll start with the last paragraph on that page so everybody who has their books if you're ready, Roman numeral xv and the last paragraph on that page.
</i>

<i>**Joe**: One of the things that has helped me over the years of studying in Bill's writings and he does this in almost all of his writings if you kind of follow along with what he does and can help you understand some of his writings. For instance he'll always tell us what the problem is, then he'll just tell us the solution to that problem, and then he'll give us a practical program of action to implement the solution that he just described. He does that in most all cases of his writings so that kind of helped me, in understanding how Bill writes. So the bottom of Roman numeral page xv. He said
</i>

> **Bill (read by Joe)**: The spark that was to flare into the first A.A. group was struck at Akron, Ohio, in June 1935, during a talk between a New York stockbroker and an Akron physician. 

<i>**Charlie**: Now we know that New York City stockbroker to be this fellow named Bill W. I think we're treating Bill pretty good when we called him a New York stockbroker he really was a New York City stock speculator he made his living out of selling fast talking to slow thinking people and they won't take anything away from Bill because he's a great man but I think we all need to realize that he's a real alcoholic just like all the rest of us and understanding that it'll make it easier to understand the book, because after all, Bill is the primary author of the book. The Akron physician is this fellow named Dr. Bob Smith.
</i>

> **Bill (read by Joe)**: Six months earlier, the broker had been relieved of his drink obsession by a sudden spiritual experience, following a meeting with an alcoholic friend who had been in contact with the Oxford Groups of that day. 

<i>**Charlie**: Then a little later on we're going to get into Bill's story, and we're going to see in Bill's story where he had, what he always called, a vital spiritual experience in the Towns Hospital in December of 1934. But prior to him having that spritual experience certain things had to take place in Bill's life and one of the things was at this meeting with the alcoholic friend took place in the latter part of November 1934, and this was a fellow named Ebby Thatcher, and Ebby sat down in Bill's kitchen and he gave Bill what turned out to be 2 vital pieces of information. 

He said Bill, people like you and I who have become absolutely powerless over alcohol, if we're going to recover from that condition we're going to have to have the aid of a Power greater than human power. He said the doctors and ministers and the psychiatrists have tried to help people like us but human power doesn't seem to be able to do the job. He said we'll have to have the aid of a Power greater than human power and he said I've been attending meetings with a group of people called the Oxford Group and they told me that if I could have a spiritual experience that during that spiritual experience I would be able to find that Power and I would be able to recover from alcoholism. He said also they have given me a practical program of action and they guaranteed me that if I would follow that program of action I would have the spiritual experience I would find the Power and I would be able to recover from alcoholism. And he said look at me Bill. It's been 2 months since I've had a drink. Now Bill knew about Ebby T. and he knew how heavy he drank. In fact Bill had always said if I ever get as bad as Ebby T. I'm going to quit drinking and here's Ebby sitting in Bill's kitchen and Bill is about 2/3rds drunk and Ebby's been sober for 2 months. This made a great impression on Bill when he told him of the solution of the vital spiritual experience. And he told him of the practical program of action necessary to have that spiritual experience. But that isn't everything Bill had to know. Let's go a little further.
</i> 

He had also been greatly helped by the late Dr. William D. Silkworth, a New York specialist in alcoholism who is now accounted no less than a medical saint by A.A. members, and whose story of the early days of our Society appears in the next pages. From this doctor, the broker had learned the grave nature of alcoholism. 

<i>**Charlie**: As we get into this, we'll be able to see how as far back as the summer of 1933, Bill was placed in the Towns Hospital for withdrawl from alcohol by Dr. Silkworth and after he's been there a few days and his mind kinda cleared up Dr. Silkworth sat down with Bill and began to explain to him his ideas about this thing concerning alcoholism and he said Bill I do not believe that alcoholism is a matter of willpower. I do not believe it's a matter of moral character and I don't think sin's got anything to do with it. He said I believe people like you are sufferring from an illness and he said it seems to be a very peculiar illness. It's a two-fold illness. An illness of the body as well as an illness of the mind and he said I think what has happened to people like you is you've become absolutely physically allergic to alcohol and it seemed to me as though anytime you put any alcohol whatsoever into your system it develops an actual physical craving which makes it virtually impossible for you to stop drinking after you have once started and he said because of that allergy which produces the physical craving you'll never be able to safely drink alcohol again and he said you also have developed what we refer to as an obsession of the mind and he said an obsession of the mind is an idea that overcomes all other ideas to the contrary and he said it really doesn't make any difference how badly you want to stop drinking from time to time your obsession of the mind to drink will be so strong that it will overcome any ideas not to drink and your mind will lead you into believing that it's okay to take a drink and he said then you will take that drink, and then you'll trigger the allergy, you'd be unable to stop. He said you can't safely drink because of your body, you can't stay sober because of your mind, therefore you've become absolutely powerless over alcohol. Now Bill knew that in the summer of 1933 but knowing the problem didn't solve it because shortly after that his mind told him it was okay to drink and he took a drink and triggered the allergy and drank for another year and in the summer of 1934 he was placed back in the hospital again to be withdrawn from alcohol by Dr. Silkworth, and this time Dr. Silkworth pronounced him incurable and told Bill's wife Lois that this guy is either going to die from DTs or he's going to become completely insane from a wet brain and you're going to have to lock him up or hire a bodyguard if you expect him to live Bill overheard that and he said this time fear sobered him for a bit. But then on Armistice Day 1934 his mind told him it was okay to drink and he took a drink and triggered the allergy and couldn't stop drinking. It's only after Ebby came to see him and gave him the solution to that problem and gave him a program of action that Bill was able to recover so basically he had to follow three things he had to know the problem, he got that from Dr. Silkwroth. He had to know the solution and the program of action that came to him from Ebby and then Bill was able to have his spiritual experience and recover from alcoholism.
</i>

<i>**Joe**: Ebby began to take Bill to Oxford Group meetings after that. He says
</i>

> **Bill (read by Joe)**: Though he could not accept all the tenets of the Oxford Groups, he was convinced of the need for moral inventory, confession of personality defects, restitution to those harmed, helpfulness to others, and the necessity of belief in and dependence upon God.

<i>**Joe**: Which were the tenets of the Oxford Group which were later expanded into the 12 Steps of Alcoholics Anonymous
</i>

> **Bill (read by Joe)**: Prior to his journey to Akron, the broker had worked hard with many alcoholics on the theory that only an alcoholic could help an alcoholic, but he had succeeded only in keeping sober himself.

<i>**Joe**: After Bill got out of the hospital that last time he began trying to help other people and he began to go out and send him out of the gutters take him to these Oxford Group meetings he began to go into bars and dragging him off a barstool and taking him up the Oxford Group meeting most of them didn't want to go but he was taking them anyhow. He's trying to sober up the world he had lots of enthusiasm but after a few months of trying to do this why nobody was staying sober, but Bill and he went to Lois, and he said, Lois, I'm trying to help these people these alcoholics stay sober nobody seems to want to stay sober and she said why don't you go talk to Dr. Silkworth and see what he has to say? So he went over to talk to Dr. Silkworth and told him the same story and Dr. Silkworth said, "Yes, I've heard some of the shenanigans you're pulling out there on the streets. He said you know Bill you're staying sober so obviously trying to help other people is helping you stay sober" and he said you're talking to those drunk about that great spiritual experience that you had and the drunks just won't accept that he said why don't you do for them what I did for you? Why don't you talk to them about the illness of alcoholism? Talk to them about the physical allergy and the obsession of the mind Show them through your experience how that worked for you. And if they will accept that then maybe you can talk to them about spiritual matters</i>

<i>**Charlie**: He said Bill every alcoholic I know has two questions:
</i>

- 1. Why can't I drink like I used to without getting drunk all the time?
- 2. Why can't I quit drinking now that I want to?

<i>**Charlie**: He said "If you would explain to them the exact nature of the illness tell them about the physical allergy of the body and the obsession of the mind You'll get their attention and he said then after you get their attention you can talk to him about spirituality but tell them what the problem is first our book says that
</i>

> **Bill (read by Charlie)**: The broker had gone to Akron on a business venture which had collapsed, leaving him greatly in fear that he might start drinking again. He suddenly realized that in order to save himself he must carry his message to another alcoholic. That alcoholic turned out to be the Akron physician.

<i>**Charlie**: We all know the story of Bill going to Akron. He and some other guys have put a business deal together they're going to take over one of the companies there in Akron just through a proxy fight and while there the whole thing blew up in their face and his friends all disserted him and left him there in Akron standing in the lobby of the Mayflower Hotel, low, sad and depressed counting the money in his pocket realized he didn't even have enough money to pay his hotel bill he happened to look through a door off the lobby into the bar and I would assume probably the lights were low in the bar the music was probably playing in the bar the laughter was great and the smoke was thick and Bill's mind said I believe I'll go in there and be with people of my kind and I'll feel better and as he started through the door his mind began to think about taking a drink and Bill suddenly realized that if he went into that bar, then he was going to end up drunk. But he remembered how back in New York City every time he tried to help another alcoholic even though he had failed with them every time he had tried he himself had felt better so he said to himself what I better do is find me a drunk here in Akron to talk to made a few phone calls came in contact with a lady named Henrietta Syberly. Henrietta said yach, I know a guy that you can talk to she said let me call him and see if I can't set up a meeting for you so she calls Dr. Bob's house and got hold of Anne Smith, Dr. Bob's wife and said there's a fellow here from New York City that says he may have a possible means that Dr. Bob could recover from alcoholism can you bring Dr. Bob over for a visit? Anne said well, I'd like to but she said you know this is the day before Mother's day and he brought me home a potted plant and it's sitting on the table and he's potted underneath the table she said let me wait until the morning and see if I can get him to come over so of course the next morning as soon as Dr. Bob woke up she sat in on him to go over to Henrietta's and see this guy and talk to this guy from New York City and you know Dr. Bob didn't feel very good the next morning hungover and felt bad and he said I'm not going and Anne kept after him and kept after him and finally, finally, Dr. Bob said I'll go over there and give that guy 15 minutes of my time, and then I'm coming back home So Anne took him over there and Bill and Bob went into a room by themselves and they stayed in that room for literally hours and Dr. Bob came out of that room and he said this is the first man I've ever met that knows what he's talking about when he talks about alcoholism. Let's see what happened to him. 
</i>

> **Bill (read by Joe)**: This physician had repeatedly tried spiritual means to resolve his alcoholic dilemma but had failed. 

<i>**Charlie**: Bill was surprised to find out Dr. Bob was already in Oxford Group. He knew more about the solution the spiritual experience and the program of action than Bill knew. But he had never been able to apply it to the depth necessary to recover because he didn't know what was wrong with him you see he thought it was willpower. He thought it was moral character. He thought it was sin. Why would he not, that's what everybody had told him up until that time. And what really interested him was a message that Bill had to carry regarding the problem--not the solution--not the program of action--but what alcoholism really consists of. He said, 
</i>

> **Bill (read by Joe)**: But when the broker gave him Dr. Silkworth’s description of alcoholism and its hopelessness, the physician began to pursue the spiritual remedy for his malady with a willingness he had never before been able to muster. He sobered, never to drink again up to the moment of his death in 1950. 

<i>**Joe**: Bill went down there at this time for the first time he began to talk to Dr. Bob about the allergy to alcoholism. He told him that every time he would go down by the bar and had every intention to have a drink or two he would drink more than he intended to and he drank more that night or the next day and he would be off and running again. He said this Dr. Silkworth had told him that was a physical allergy that caused him to want to crave more drinks after he took a drink and Dr. Bob said "Well, Yes, I drink just like that. You know, you really know what you're talking about. That's the way I drink, too." I would want to have one or two drinks the next thing I know is I drink 3 or 4 or 5 or 15 or 20 and I didn't know how I got started he said that you call that a physical allergy then he said that's right and he said another thing is when I'm not drinking when I'm sober I have these thoughts that I want to drink all the time it's always on my mind and Dr. Silkworth said that's the obsession of the mind that we're obsessed with the idea to drink and Dr. Bob said well I have those same kind of thoughts you really know what you're talking about so they reached a repport through the illness of alcoholism and explained it in great detail and Dr. Bob said that's me. That's just the way I drink you really know what you're talking about so they had some identification going.
</i>

<i>**Charlie**: This is the first time that Bill had tried this everybody back in New York City he had always talked to them without the solution the great spiritual experience the big white flash he had in Towns Hospital sitting with Dr. Bob he didn't talk to Dr. Bob at all about Dr. Bob's drinking either I'm sure that's what Dr. Bob expected to head everybody else had talked to him about his drinking but Bill said let me tell you about my drinking and through the sharing of his story talking about his own allergy Dr. Bob could see himself immediately in it through the sharing of his own story talking about his obsession of the mind Dr. Bob could see himself immediately in it and he could see where he had become absolutely powerless over alcohol and for the first time he was completely defeated when it comes to alcohol.

<i>**Charlie**: Then he began to apply the little program of action to a depth he had never been able to do before then he had a spiritual experience and he recovered from alcoholism too. 
</i>

> **Bill (read by Charlie)**: This seemed to prove that one alcoholic could affect another as no nonalcoholic could. 

<i>**Charlie**: You know throught the sharing of our story with a new person we can affect them as no non-alcoholic could because we have immediate identification about the physical allergy about the obsession of the mind about the way we think and the things that we do 
</i>

> **Bill (read by Charlie)**: It also indicated that strenuous work, one alcoholic with another, was vital to permanent recovery.

<i>**Charlie**: Remember, Bill was about to get drunk--and he really didn't go see Dr. Bob to sober up Dr. Bob. He went to see Dr. Bob to keep Bill W. from drinking. So it proved that night that working with another alcoholic was vital for our own recovery, too. 
</i>

<i>**Charlie**: Now, immediately--one of the Oxford Group tenets was: you've got to give it away if you're going to keep it. So immediately, made a decision we're going to have to find another alcoholic to talk to.

<i>**Charlie**: Dr. Bob called the Akron City Hospital where he was actually working at that time talked to the head nurse and he said,
</i>

<i>**Dr. Bob Smith**: Do you have an alcoholic down there that we can come and talk to? We believe we have found a way to help him overcome alcoholism.
</i>

<i>**Head nurse**: Oh yeah we've got a real one down here. He's just blacked both eyes of one of the nurses. We got him tied down in bed. 
</i>

<i>**Dr. Bob Smith**: Put him in a private room, we'll be down in the morning to see him.
</i>

<i>**Head nurse**: Okay--and by the way, Dr. Bob--have you tried this on yourself?
</i>

<i>**Charlie**: So the next morning they go down to see this fellow, named Bill Dotson and you see the picture in A.A. rooms all over the world of the man on the bed. This is Bill and Bob sitting there talking to Bill Dotson. 
</i>

<i>**Charlie**: Now they didn't talk to Bill Dotson about Bill Dotson's drinking. They talked to him about their own drinking and through the sharing of their stories Bill Dotson could immediately see what his problem was. 
</i>

<i>**Charlie**: You see he had never known about the allergy and the obsession of the mind he could accept the fact that he was absolutely powerless over alcohol and he would have to have the aid of a Power greater than himself in order to recover. 
</i>

<i>**Charlie**: They began to talk to him about the need for the spiritual experience how they had found that necessary to apply those things in their lives in order to recover they told him how they applied the little program of action and the results that they got. 
</i>

<i>**Charlie**: Two days later Bill Dotson said to his wife</i>

<i>**Bill Dotson**: Get my clothes out of the closet. I'm going home</i>

<i>**Charlie**: And he got up, and he dresses and he goes home and he starts applying the program of action. 
</i>

<i>**Charlie**: And lo and behold he had a vital spiritual experience and he recovered from alcoholism also.
</i>

<i>**Charlie**: Now this makes 3 of them.</i>

<i>**Charlie**: In the summer of 1935 in Akron all three know the problem all three know the solution all three applied the program of action they've had a spiritual experience and they have recovered from alcoholism
</i>

> <span class="text-muted">Hence the two men set to work almost frantically upon alcoholics arriving in the ward of the Akron City Hospital. Their very first case, a desperate one, recovered immediately and became A.A. number three. He never had another drink.</span>

> **Bill (read by Joe)**: This work at Akron continued through the summer of 1935. There were many failures, but there was an occasional heartening success. 

<i>**Charlie**: We always give credit to Bill and Bob and the first 100 which rightly we should. But if we would go back and think about that summer of 1935, these guys really didn't have much idea about what they were doing. They had found a few simple things that had worked for them. And they would try this on many, many different people that summer, and if it worked, then they would keep it, and if it didn't work, then they might discard that. Learning as they went through that summer working with people. I know one of Dr. Bob's favorite things was to fill them up with Sauerkraut juice mixed with Honey. He knew that there were vitamins in that Sauerkraut juice that would help the body and he knew that Honey was a form of energy. And they tried that among many different things. Every once in a while one of these guys would fall over dead. And I can almost see Bill turn to Bob and say oh SHIT! Let's don't do that again. I think maybe we ought to give credit to those they failed with that summer too. They probably learned more from their failures than they did from their successes.
</i>

> **Bill (read by Joe)**: When the broker returned to New York in the fall of 1935, the first A.A. group had actually been formed, though no one realized it at the time.

<i>**Joe**: This little group of alcoholics that were going to the Oxford Group, they were having troubles with the Oxford Group because the Oxford Group had 4 Absolutes and the drunks were having trouble being absolutely anything as we well know they couldn't practice that, and it seemed like these drunks liked to stand off in a corner somewhere and drink coffee and smoke cigarettes and tell stories not necessarily mix in with the other Oxford Group meeting members so they began to call them the Drunk Squad of the Oxford Group. And that's what they liked to separate themselves from the normal Oxford Group members.
</i>

> **Bill (read by Charlie)**: A second small group promptly took shape at New York, 

<i>**Charlie**: When Bill went back to New York City he began to apply there what he had learned in Akron instead of talking about spirituality he talked to the new people there about the exact nature of the illness and sure enough he got their attention. Some of them began to respond and a second little group started in New York City.
</i>

> <span class="text-muted">to be followed in 1937 with the start of a third at Cleaveland. 

> **Bill (read by Charlie)**: Besides these, there were scattered alcoholics who had picked up the basic ideas in Akron or New York who were trying to form groups in other cities.</span>

> **Bill (read by Charlie)**: By late 1937, the number of members having substantial sobriety time behind them was sufficient to convince the membership that a new light had entered the dark world of the alcoholic.

<i>**Charlie**: In the summer of 1937 Bill was back in Akron again on a business venture and he decided to go by and see Dr. Bob and see how things were going in Akron. And they sit down in Dr. Bob's kitchen and they counted the number of people that they knew that were staying sober based on these three little pieces of information and they found approximately 40 people sober. And I think that's the first time that they really began to realize maybe we really have found the answer to this thing called alcoholism and if we found the answer then we need to get it to as many alcoholics as we possibly can. So the question immediately becomes, well, What's the best way to do that? And maybe this is the beginning of the Group Conscience. Bill and Bob decided they didn't want to make that decision themselves it was too important and they called a meeting of the Oxford Group there in Akron and at that meeting that night there was 18 people there some alcoholics some nonalcoholic and the topic of conversation was how can we best carry this message of recovery to the greatest number of people now they decided that night to do three things. In those days you could hardly get an alcoholic in a hospital for detoxification any doctor that put one in there had to lie about their condition. Alcoholism wasn't very popular in the 1930s. that's for sure so they decided now remember this is in the midst of the depression now in 1932 nobody has a dime hardly anybody at all and they decided what they needed to do was build a chain of hospitals stretching all the way across the United States where any alcoholic that needed it would be able to have detoxification. I would assume that Dr. Bob was going to be the head doctor. They also felt that this little message of recovery they had was so vital that not everybody could be entrusted with carrying it correctly so they decided they needed to hire a group of individuals train them and let them spread out accross the United States more or less as missionaries to carry this message of recovery. I would assume Bill W. was going to be the head missionary. Then they said, you know, the Oxford Group have written a lot of books spiritual in nature and they've been very popular. Back in the 1930s people read a lot of books this was in the days before television. There really was a time before television believe me there was and they felt that if they could come up with a book on alcoholism, what it is, the solution to it and a way to bring that about, the first comprehensive book on alcoholism the world had ever seen then surely this book would become one of the world's greatest bestsellers and they can take the profits from the book and build the hospitals and train the missionaries. That was one reason behind the book but I think the main reason behind the book was that they had already noticed carrying this message one on one, one person to another that it already begun to be changed. And you know how people are when we hear something good well we like to repeat it. Well we'll usually add just a little bit too it and then the next one will add a little more and a little more and after a while it doesn't resemble the first thing. And they said what we really need to do is take these three pieces of information about the problem, the solution, and a program of action, put it down in a written form where it will no longer be changed, no longer be garbled, and any alcoholic anywhere in the world in the future would have this same information it would be pure. And they made the decision that night to write the Big Book of Alcoholics Anonymous. Now thank God only one of the 3 things they decided that night came true. They never did get to build the hospitals because the book didn't make very much money in the beginning. They didn't get to hire and train the missionaries. But they did get to write the book.
</i>

> <span class="text-muted">It was now time, the struggling groups thought, to place their message and unique experience before the world.</span>

> **Bill (read by Joe)**: This determination bore fruit in the spring of 1939 by the publication of this volume. The membership had then reached about 100 men and women. 

<i>**Joe**: And after they wrote the book they sat down one night at a meeting and they were trying to determine what they were going to call the book. They needed a title for the book. Someone said, well, let's call it "The Way Out" that sounds like a pretty good name for a book. They did some research on that later and they found out there was some 10 or 12 other books called "The Way Out" so they discarded that. Somebody else suggested, well, let's call it "Comes the Dawn" now that sounds like a pretty good title for a book and they discussed that a while and kick that around and somebody decided not to do that. Somebody said, let's call it "100 men" now that really sounds like the good name of a book, well then a woman joined the group. Well they couldn't call it one hundred men and a woman. So they discarded that idea. Bill suggested that they call it the Bill W. movement. They discussed that about 5 minutes to kick that out. And then one evening someone suggested that we're alcoholics and we want to remain anonymous, how about "Anonymous Alcoholics" or "Alcoholics Anonymous" and so that's what they called the book. Alcoholics Anonymous. And the first Alcoholics Anonymous that the world has ever seen was a book called "Alcoholics Anonymous." It says here
</i>

> **Bill (read by Joe)**: The fledgling society, which had been nameless, now began to be called Alcoholics Anonymous, from the title of its own book. 

<i>**Joe**: So we have two Alcoholics Anonymouses don't we. We have a book entitled Alcoholics Anonymous and then we have a fellowship entitlted Alcoholics Anonymous. Two A.A.'s and we still have that today.
</i>

> <span class="text-muted">The flying-blind period ended and A.A. entered a new phase of its pioneering time.</span>

<i>**Charlie**: Now I think this is very important for us to think about. This group of people who had been nameless who had been known as the Drunk Squad of the Oxford Group wrote a book and in that book they put their program of recovery and they called the book Alcoholics Anonymous. Then after the book was published they then decided to call themselves Alcoholics Anonymous. Now in 1939, the program in the book Alcoholics Anonymous and the program in the fellowship Alcoholics Anonymous were exactly the same. The book then began to go out across the United States and the first person out here in California got a copy of this book. Read it, studied it, did what it said, recovered from alcoholism, started a group called Alcoholics Anonymous. The first person in Arkansas got a copy of this book, read it, studied it, did what it said, recovered, started a group called Alcoholics Anonymous. Now the growth of the fellowship began to come from the book Alcoholics Anonymous. Now as the fellowship began to grow and get bigger and bigger and bigger, they began to notice something that the first 100 didn't have. They began to notice the great Power of a fellowship of a people who have escaped from a common problem. Now the first 100 didn't have that they only had 100 people period. But the fellowship as it grew and got bigger and bigger and bigger, and it began t oexperienec the power of fellowship they then begin to question the need for the severity of the program in the book and they said do you mean we really have to turn all of our will and our life over to the care of God as we undrestand Him? Can we give Him the drinking and keep the rest? Do you mean we're going to have to share all of our life story with another human being. Hell, God already knows about it we know about it, why tell somebody else? They begin to say you mean we have to have God remove all of our character defects? Hell, we won't have any personality left if we do. And they begin to talk about do you mean we have to make amends to all those people we've harmed? And they begin to say such things as, well, maybe we don't need to do every bit of that. Maybe we could take some of it and leave some of it. Maybe we can do it cafeteria-style. Pick what we want and leave that that we don't want. And then along about that time came the great advent of the treatment centers. Now please don't gte us wrong we have nothing against the treatment center. They serve a worthwhile purpose. But in the treatment centers people begin to hear some other type of words and some other languages they begin to go into a group therapy thing and they begin to sit around the tables and talk about their problems and they and they begin to develop such terms as the dysfunctional family. And they begin to use such words as chemical dependency and begin to talk about significant others and they begin to discuss meaningful relationsihps and they begin to talk about dysfunctional sex. And they begin to talk about this and they begin to talk about that and the program in the treatment center wasn't like the program in the book Alcoholics Anonymous. Well naturally the people from the treatment centers coming into A.A. wanted to talk about what they knew it to talk about what they had learned in other places. And slowly, slowly, slowly, the program and the fellowship began to change. And as the years went by it began to change more and more and more. We like to refer to those meetings as group depression meetings. You go in there feeling pretty good, half-way through the meeting you might as well just go ahead and blow your brains out, hell it's not even worth living any longer. So what we're going to talk about this weekend is not the program in the fellowship of Alcoholics Anonymous today. We're going to talk about the program in the book Alcoholics Anonymous that the first 100 use which has never been changed.
