### Taking inventory and responsibility (PLBB)

<i>**Charlie**: Let's go to the bottom of page 63. We've made our decision, We've made our prayer and the book says
</i>

**Bill (read by Charlie)**: Next we launched out on a course of vigorous action, the first step of which is a personal housecleaning, which many of us had never attempted. Though our decision 

<i>**Joe**: Step 3
</i>

was vital and crucial step, it could have little permanent effect unless at once followed by a strenuous effort to face, and to be rid of, the things in ourselves which had been blocking us. Our liquor was but a symptom. So we had to get down to causes and conditions.

<i>**Charlie**: Now, we always like to stop here for just a moment and look at the time element between Step 3 and Step 4. We always hear people asking the question. How long do you wait after you do Step 3 until you start on Step 4. And we hear all kind of answers. They'll say well 30 days, maybe 90 days, or maybe 6 months. We heard a professional in the field one time counseling people to wait a minimum or 2 years, and our question back to that person was, "How many people have you killed with that statement?" You see, we're trying to find a way to live where we not only can we be sober, but we can have a little piece of mind serenity and happiness. And every day that we put off and procrastinate Step 4 is a day that we're still filled with resentments a day that we're still filled with shame, fear, guilt, and remorse. Another day that we don't feel good and we really don't know how many days we could go without our mind beginning to think about taking a drink. The next thing you know we've convinced ourselves that it's okay to drink end up drunk all over again. I don't know how many days I could go under those conditions, and frankly I'm not interested in finding out. Our book tells us when we should take Step 4. Step 3
</i>

**Bill (read by Charlie)**: <span class="text-muted">will have little permanent effect unless at once followed by this strenuous effort</span> 

<i>**Charlie**: which is Step 4. You know that does make sense, doesn't it as far back as far back as I can remember, 4 has always followed immediately after 3.
</i>

<i>**Charlie**: Now, knowing that, and knowing that we might get drunk if we don't get on with Step 4, then why would we still tend to procrastinate, and I think 2 reasons behind it, number one is fear. Some of our older members tend to play king of the mountain with this step. And we tell the newcomer just how tough it is. By God just wait until you get to Step 4. Bla bla bla. We just literally scare them to death. Let us say to day, that if we take Step 4 according to the Big Book of Alcoholics Anonymous there is nothing whatsoever to be afraid of. I think were all going to see that in just a little bit. Knowing that there's nothing to be afraid of, then there's still tend to procrastinate. I think probably one of the greatest reasons is simply confusion. For years, we could not see how to do Step 4 according to the Big Book. But the reason we couldn't do it is the instructions are there but they are so simple that our keen alcoholics with our keen intellectual alcoholic minds looking for something more complicated overlook the simplicity of Step 4. So in our desperation we read over in Step 5 something about sharing all your life story. We say, "Oh that's what they want us to do in Step 4. Is to write our life story so we could share it in Step 5" That's what I did in the beginning. Now my life story was not important to other people, but it must have been to me there was 92 pages in it. I took it to another poor suffering human being and I asked them to read it and they did. He said "Not very pretty, is it?" I said "No it isn't." He said "You'll never have to be that way again." He threw it in the wastepaper basket.
 
And I learned nothing from my life story to contribute to my alcoholism certainly nothing new because everything I wrote down, I already knew it so nothnig new came out of it. Today I realize that 95% of my life story really doesn't have anything to do with my alcoholism anyhow. The fact that I was born in 1929 I don't think it has a thing to do with my alcoholism. It might have something to do with someone elses alcoholism, but not mine. The fact that I graduated from high school at age 17 went immediately in the service, I don't think has anything to do with my alcoholism. The  fact that I was married at age 21 don't think it has anything to do with it. But I tell you what it did, the 95% that didn't very effectively covered up the 5% that did and I learned nothing from my life story to contribute to my alcoholism. So in our desperation again someone in miniapolis, MN wrote a 4th Step inventory guide. We took the Miniapolis guide and combined it with the Big Book and got more confused yet. Someone in Dallas, TX wrote a 4th Step inventory guide. We took the Dallas guide, combined it with the Miniapolis guide, combined it with the Big Book and got more confused yet. Today we saw one floating around today. We saw one that had 20 pages in it. I'll guarentee if you wasn't crazy as hell when you took it you would be when you were through with it, it was one of those all the time the instructions have been here we just never could see them before because we didn't understand how Bill writes and I think today if we can just kind of sit back and relax look at a few simple ideas we're going to see how easy this thing really is there's two things we got to remember: first he loved to use comparisons. talking about one thing that we already know to teach us something new. Also he did not like to repeat himself using the same words over and over. So he would tell us something then turn around and tell it again but use different words the second time. And bearing those two thoughts in mind I think we can see how simple this thing really is. He says
</i>

**Bill (read by Charlie)**: Therefore, <span class="bg-direction">we started upon a personal inventory</span>. *This was Step Four*. 

<i>**Charlie**: Immediately he jumps into business. He says
</i>

**Bill (read by Charlie)**: A business which takes no regular inventory usually goes broke. 

<i>**Charlie**: I think his first comparison is this. If you had a business and I don't care what it is, selling ladies purses, mens' watches, bicycles or whatever. If you didn't inventory once in awhile and by the way inventory is defined as a written list of items. If you didn't go in there and make a list of the things that are in there, then you wouldn't know what's been stolen that you didn't get paid for. If you didn't inventory once in awhile you wouldn't know what's been sold and you need to reorder to put new stock in its place if you didn't inventory once in awhile you wouldn't know what's become damaged, it's sitting there taking up valuable floor space day after day after day. You're probably paying interest on borrowed money to put it there in the first place. If you didn't inventory once in awhile you wouldn't know what's become out of style. You need to put it on sale to get it out of the store to put something new in its place. If you had a business and you didn't inventory once in awhile you would go broke and I think we can all see that.

Okay in our personal lives we have a businesss too it's the greatest business in the world for us. It's the business of finding a way to live where we can have a little peace of mind serenity and happines so we don't have to go back to drinking, and if you don't inventory what's damaged and unsaleable in our heads that's going to cause us to go broke too, and going broke for us is going back to drinking. In either case, we would probably go broke without the inventory. Now then he's going to tell us how to take a business inventory. Now he could have used the word commmercial again, but he used business. Taking a commercial inventory Joe up here on the screen, and you have it in your handout material it's going to be called inventory comparison, I think it's Step 5 in your handout sheet. On one side it says business and one side says personal. We're going to take words out of the Big Book and put it under business. He said
</i>

**Bill (read by Charlie)**: Taking commercial inventory is a fact-finding 

<i>**Charlie**: And we're putting "fact-finding" under business.
</i>

**Bill (read by Charlie)**: and a fact-facing process. 

<i>**Charlie**: And we're putting "fact-facing" under business.
</i>

**Bill (read by Charlie)**: It is an effort to discover the truth 

<i>**Charlie**: And we're putting "truth" under business.
</i>

**Bill (read by Charlie)**: about the stock-in-trade. 

<i>**Charlie**: And we're putting "stock-in-trade" under business. The stock-in-trade is what's in there to sell. Ladies purses, the men's watches, the bicycles or whatever.
</i>

**Bill (read by Charlie)**: One object is to disclose damaged or unsalable goods, 

<i>**Charlie**: And we're putting "one object" under business. disclose damaged or unsalable goods...
</i>

**Bill (read by Charlie)**: to get rid of them promptly and without regret. 


<i>**Charlie**: And we're putting "promptly and without regret" under business. In other words we're going to go in there and we're going to try and find the facts and when we find them we're going to face the facts we're looking for the truth about the stock-in-trade. We're trying to find the damaged and unsaleable goods. The good items will not cause us to go broke. Oh they resell everyday, and we're making money off of them. The damaged and unsaleable goods they're the ones that's blocking the floor space and the shelf space and costing us money. When we finally find them we're going to try and get rid of them promptly and without regret. We can't put anything new in their place until they're gone. We're trying to find the stock-in-trade that's damaged and get it out of there.
</i>

If the owner of the business is to be successful, he cannot fool himself about values.

<i>**Charlie**: He's got to be honest. Once in awhile he'll try to fool himself. Well the reason these ladies' are buying these purses is that they just don't understand what's good for them. He made the decision to buy them, and he hates to admit that he made a mistake. He may keep them in there longer than he should, and it's going to keep costing him money, everyday. Does anyone in here have any problem with what he's told us about the business inventory? That we're going to try to find the facts. When we find them we're going to face them. We're looking for the truth about the stock-in-trade. We're looking for the damaged and unsalable goods, when we get rid of them, promptly and without regret. Always looking for the stock-in-trade that's damaged. Anybody got any problems there? He used a series of words to tell us how to take our personal inventory, which basically means the same thing. He said 
</i>

**Bill (read by Charlie)**: We did exactly the same thing with our lives. We took stock honestly. 

<i>**Charlie**: So we go to Step Four, and Step Four says now we're under personal on the right hand side of the sheet. Step Four said we've made a searching and we're putting searching right across from fact-finding. They mean the same thing. To find the facts, to search our the facts. We made a searching fearless and we're putting fearless straight across from fact-facing. They mean the same thing. To face the facts, to fearlessly look at them. We made a searching fearless moral, and there's where we got in trouble. We said, "Oh, Damn" there's that list of dirty filthy nasty items. And we don't want to look at them and we sure as hell don't want to show them to anybody else. Now I'm not sure what all Bill knew but I do know one thing. This guy understood the English language. And I really believe that if he wanted you and I to make a list of dirty filthy nasty items he would have said we made a searching and fearless amoral or immoral inventory. He didn't say that, he said moral. Bugged the hell out of us. Then eventually we went back to the dictionary. Do you know what the word "moral" is defined as? Truth. Things as they really are. The right and wrong of any given situation. The truth about things. So truth and moral mean exactly the same thing. We made a searching and fearless moral inventory of what? Of ourselves. We're the only stock-in-trade in this business of staying sober. Nobody else can make us sober. And nobody else can make us drink. Oh I'll agree they can make us thirsty as hell once in awhile, but they can't make us drink. We decide whether we drink or not. What part of us decides wether we drink or not. Is it our body, or is it our mind? The real problem of the alcoholic centers in the mind. So we're going to look inside ourselves in our minds, and we're going to find those flawed thinking processes, which is the damaged and unsaleable goods that block us off from God. Now we've made a decision to turn our will over to God and as long as our mind is filled with damaged and unsaleable goods, then God can't direct our thinking. We're going to have to find them, and once we find them, we're going to have to get rid of them promptly and without regret. And when those flawed thinking processes leave our minds, then our mind has openned up for God's thinking to enter. But it's only after they are gone that God can enter. Now there are 3 common manifestations of a life run on self-will. The flawed thinking processes in our mind that blocks God out are our resentments, fear, guilt and remorse associated with the harms done to other people. As long as our mind is occupied with those thoughts, then God's thoughts can't come in. Now I like to look at my head up here is a little bitty store, not much, a little bitty quick trip or 7-11 not a hell of a lot in it, never has been. Over here in my store I've got some display cases and they are filled with resentments. Damn him, damn her. By God I'll show them. Bla bla bla. Those display cases are already full. God simply cannot get in there because he is blocked out by the damaged and unsaleable goods called resentments. Over here in this part of my store, and it's filled with fear. Oh my God, what's she going to do when she finds out about this one? Oh my God, what's the banker going to do when that check hits the bank this time? He's already told me he's going to file on me next time. Oh my God, is that my car sitting out there in front end torn up. Oh my God, and on and on. God can't get in there. He's very effectively blocked out by those fears. Back here in the back of my store, I've got a little file room, and it's filled with guilt and remorse. God dwells in each of us. We know the difference between right and wrong. We do these things that hurt other people. We're scared to death what they're going to do when they find out and the guilt and remorse begins to eat us up. God can't get in that store room, he's already blocked out of there. An emergency phone call for whom? I hope everything is alright.

Now if I want God to direct my thinking, then I'm going to have to do something about the removal about this guilt and remorse, and if I can remove them, then God's thinking can enter into my mind and direct those portions of my mind where God was blocked out. The book is getting ready to show me just exactly how to look at these things truthfully. It's getting erady to show me how to remove them the greatest thing it's going to show me is how to keep them from coming back in the future. And if I do my part, then God can direct my thinking. But until I've done my part, God can't it's just that simple. He says

<hr/>

**Bill (read by Charlie)**: <span class="bg-warning">Resentment is the "number one" offender.</span> <span class="bg-warning">It destroys more alcoholics than anything else. From it stem all forms of spiritual disease, for we have been not only mentally and physically ill, we have been spiritually sick.</span> <span class="bg-promise">When the spiritual malady is overcome, we straighten out mentally and physically.</span> <span class="bg-direction">In dealing with resentments, we set them on paper.</span>

<i>**Charlie**: So the first thing we're going to do is look at these resentments. Now I think we need to look at that word, and make sure we understand what it means. The word "resentment" is made up of two little words. First is the letters "re-." When you see "re-" in front of a word, it means to do again--replay, redo--it always means to do again. The last part of the word, "-sentment," comes from an old word "sentire," which means to feel. So the word "resentment" itself means to "re-feel". 

Okay. Let's say we're going through life, which we do on a daily basis. Remember always that everybody has got self-will--that's one of the problems with life. It's standard equipment; everybody's got self-will. From time to time, everybody tends to get sick in self. Maybe their social instinct is out of kelter. Maybe their security instinct is fouled up. And they do something to me that threatens one of my basic instincts of life. 

Maybe they put me down in the eyes of other people, and it threatens my self-esteem. Maybe they do something that threatens one of my personal relationships. Maybe they've ripped me off and stolen my money. Maybe they've done something to interfere with my sex life. Or maybe they do something that threatens one of my ambitions for the future. 

That's one of their wrongs--it's not a resentment yet. It doesn't become a resentment until I go over into the next room, or I go home that evening and I replay that thing in my mind, and I feel the pain the second time. The first time they did it to me, it hurt me. But when I when I go over here and replay it, and feel the pain a second time, then I've done it to myself. They did it the first time, but I'm going it the second time. 

And after a while, I'll replay it again, and I'll feel the pain the third time. And what I've found in my life is that I'm not always completely honest with myself. Because it seems as though when I replay this thing, each time I tend to change it just a little bit. And I tend to make what they did to me just a little bit worse. I tend to make what I did just a little bit less. I tend to make the pain just a little bit deeper. 

And if you let me play it over in my head enough times. After a while I would say to myself, "I was just standing there doing nothing. And they come along and did it to me." 

I love to watch football games. In a football game, you'll see a guy called the quarterback. Sometimes he'll throw a pass, and the guy whose supposed to recieve it--many times it's thrown up high on purpose so the other guys can't catch it. The guy who is going to receive it often has to jump high up in the air to catch it. 

Now the members of the opposing team have learned that if you can hit this guy while he's still up in the air before he gets real control of that ball, then you can knock it loose from him. So they wait until he jumps up in the air, and when that ball touches his fingers, they knock the hell out of him. He's completely defenceless. They'll hit him, and maybe he'll turn upside down. He'll fall on his head, his neck bends sideways, his legs spread apart, one arm bends completely behind his back--and it just hurts the hell out of him. 

Now the football game is like the game of life. It's going to go on. They're not going to stop it very long. One of two things happens for this guy. They'll run out there and check him over, and if he isn't hurt too bad, they'll pump a little air in him and get up and get him going again. If he's hurt too bad, then they'll drag him off to the side, they'll put somebody in his place, and the game starts again. The football game is going to continue--I don't care what's happened. 

Now the announcer up in the booth has got a resentment machine. After a while he'll say, "Let's look at that again." And this time it's in slow motion and living color. My God--it looks twice as bad as it did the first time. You can see how far his neck really did bend, how far his legs spread apart, and how far that arm was bent--and it looks twice as bad as it did the first time. 

After a while the announcer will say, "Let's look at that again." The game has been going on now for 15 minutes. The announcer is still bouncing this guy up and down, up and down off the ground. 

Now we alcoholics have up here, up in our heads, a resentment replay machine. We get up in the morning and we tune it up in living color. We clean the lens on it because we don't want to miss anything. We shine it on the world all day long. We record everything they do to us that's bad. We go home at night and play it over in our head and make ourselves sick--and blame it on them. 

Once in a while, we have a bad day. Once in a great while, they won't do anything to us.
</i>

<i>**Joe**: That's a bad day for an alcoholic.
</i>

<i>**Charlie**: We've got our machine cleaned up, the lens is cleaned too, we're shining it on the world, and nobody will do anything to us. We don't have anything bad to record. 
</i>

<i>**Joe**: We don't record nothing good.
</i>

<i>**Charlie**: Do you know what we record those days. By God we record what they're thinking, that's what we do. We go home at night play it over in our head and make ourself sick. Now there's a bad thing about a resentment. Because each time you play it over in your head, each time you throw it out there, after while it turns around and comes back at you. And when it comes back at you, it comes back as self-resentment. And we begin to resent ourselves for being in a position to have those things happen to us. And after while self-resentments turns into self-pity. And that's the sickest, sickest that a human being can be is to be filled with self-pity. And we alcoholics love self-pity. We like to get up early in the morning, put self-pity on the cloak of dignity, and as we go out the door we say "Here I come mean old world, just do it to me, because I know you always do." It is a sick, sick way to build our self-esteem. The whole world is picking on us we must really be somebody. And my God we love that self-pity. If you want to make them mad, you feel sorry for one of those of us. We'll tell you in a hurry, "Don't you feel sorry for me, that's my damn job!" Is there any way that God can enter a mind filled with that kind of crap? No way. Thinking is controlled and dominated by these resentments and all of the things that go along with it. God is absolutely completely blocked out of our mind by these resentments. At the very least, we're going to have to do something about them. Now the intructions on how to do them are here, in the Big Book of Alcoholics Anonymous, but they're so simple, that we never could see them before. We've given you a sheet in your handout material called a review of resentments. I believe that's pages 9 and 10. What I would ask you to do now is take those last 2 columns, and fold them over to where you can't even see them. Where all you're looking at is collumn 1, 2, and 3. The example on page 65 has already been filled out, and we didn't know the procedure that Bill used to fill it out. So when we give them to you in the first 3 columns, is page 65 in the blank form. We're trying to emphasize that we're not trying to bring another inventory in A.A. we've already got enough of those. Page 65, the resentment sheet that you have, is 65 and the blank form. Column 1 "I'm Resentful At" Column 2 "The Cause" Column 3 "Affects My" Let's see if we can't find the instructions on how to fill it out in dealing with resentments we set them on paper. Okay, you've got the paper now. We're going to start setting them down.
</i>

<i>**Joe**: You know we're always taught to read from left to right. And if you read from left to right trying to figure out the inventory, you will start with the Mr. Brown, and then you write down your resentment, and then you change your mind and go to the second column and write down the cause, then you change your mind and you go to what part of the self was affected and you have to use those basic instincts of life and write down what part of self was affected. Then you'd go back to the first column mentally, and write down Mrs. Jones and then you change your mind again and go to the second column we get the idea if you do that long enough, if you have a mind like mine, it says "tilt." Too much information and I say, "What the hell all they wanted was my life story anyhow" So this I just disregard this. We didn't know how to fill out this column. It seems to us that you fill this out one column at a time from top to bottom. Leaving some space in between the names in column 1. So you fill that in column 2 a little bit later. Because in our book it says 
</i>


**Bill (read by Joe)**: <span class="bg-direction">We listed people, institutions or principle with who we were angry.</span> 

<i>**Joe**: Period. From top to bottom in column 1 we simply write down all of the
</i>

**Bill (read by Joe)**: <span class="text-muted">people, institutions or principle with who we were angry.</span> 

<i>**Joe**: From top to bottom, leaving a little space between each one of them, all the way down.
</i>

<i>**Charlie**: People, that's self explanatory. Institutions are those things such as the police department, the internal revenue service. The federal government, the church, etc. Principals are those old, old guiding--I hate to use the word laws but it's the only thing I can think of--natural laws that's interfered with our style of living. The 10 commandments, that's a set of principles. And when I was out there drinking I don't want to hear nothing about the 10 commandments. I'm breaking all them but one, and maybe I broke it in a blackout too, I don't know. Another principle I've always hated says "What goes up must come down" I never cared for that one. Another one says "What you give out is what you get back." Another one said "There are no free rides," you'll pay for whatever you get. My dad used to say, "When you lay down with dogs you'll get fleas on you every time." Those old, old principles that interfered with our style of living. Now you don't need o be sober very long to do this. All we got to do is take these things out of our head, and put them down on paper. You don't have to have a high education to do this. If you can't write, then you feed the names to somebody else and let them write them down. And while our mind is on one thing only, let's fill out the first column from top to bottom. I've never seen an alcoholic yet that did not know just who and what--by God--we're mad at. We spent thousands of hours in bars talking about it. All we gotta do is take it out of our head, and put it down on a piece of paper, and we will have completed the first instruction. Hopefully the same thing will happen to you that happened to me when you do this. They came to me and said, "List your resentments." I said, "I don't have any." And they said "Surely you got one or two." Maybe you don't understand what the resentment is and they explained to me that it was to re-feel old pains and old hurts. And I said "Yeah, I got a couple of those". They said "Put them on paper. Leave a little space in between each one." So I got a sheet of paper, and leaving a space between, like the book does. First thing I knew was I had about 8 names on that sheet of paper. So I reached over and got another sheet of paper, and after awhile I had 8 more listed, and I got another sheet of paper, and the next thing I knew I had 8 more listed, and so I got another sheet of paper. I got up to about 152, and I said you're madder at hell at everything. I did not know that. You can only see one resentment at a time in your head. I don't think any of us will ever see how many resentments we really do have, and how much they controlled and dominate our thinking, until we put them on a sheet of paper, and see them in their entirety for the first time. Now we've made the decision to let God direct our thinking. And if we've got that many resentments, and resentments direct our thinking then God can't, and it's just that simple. Just by the listing of the names, we learn something very valuable about ourselves. How resentful we really are. You just can't see this stuff on your head, it's got to go on paper, so we filled out the first column. Bill said "Mr. Brown, Mrs. Jones, my employer, and my wife" He probably had more than that, I think he just didn't want to use any more space in the Big Book. Mine was that long, long list of about 152 names. Joe?
</i>

**Bill (read by Joe)**: <span class="bg-direction">We asked ourselves why we were angry.</span> 

<i>**Joe**: Period. Stop right there, and go the second column, "The Cause." In the illustration he used here very short and sweet. Just 4 or 5 little words, not too many words to describe the cause. Simplicity is the key here in the second column. He's resentful at Mr. Brown, Why? "His attentions to my wife. / He told my wife of my mistress. Brown may get my job at the office." I don't know Mr. Brown, but I'm already mad at him myself. Now he's resentful at Mrs. Jones because "She's a nut / She snubbed me / She committed her husband for drinking, he's my friend / She's a gossip" What she did was put his old drinking buddy in the nut house, and he don't like that at all. He's mad at his employer, Why? Well, "He's unreasonable, unjust, overbearing."
</i>

<i>**Charlie**: He probably said "Say Bill, by the way, where were you all the day yesterday, anyhow?"
</i>

<i>**Joe**: "He threatends to fire me for drinking and padding my expense account."
</i>

<i>**Charlie**: That unreasonable as hell isn't it.
</i>

<i>**Joe**: Very narrow-minded. He's really mad at his wife. "She misunderstands and nags, and she likes old Brown, and she wants the house put in her name." Tie that together put the house in her name it's about time to get a little upset isn't it?  So simply in the second column we just write down why we were angry beside each name one at a time using 4 or 5 little words to describe the cause. There may be one cause or 2 or 3 causes. But we simply write them down in the seccond column
</i>

<i>**Charlie**: We're not going to write any big long essays, just a few simple words by each name. There may be one cause or there may be multiple causes as we have here. Whatever it is we put it down. I filled out the second column, and I begin to realize something that has become very valuable to me. I begin to realize it's not the people and the institutions that I'm upset with. It's what they've done to me that's got me upset. I can take Mr. Brown out of here, and put Mr. Green in. I'll be just as upset with Green as I am with Brown if he does the same thing to me. I can take Mrs. Jones out of here, and put Mrs. Smith in. If Smith does the same thing I'm going to be just as upset with her as I am with Jones. I can put my wife our of here and put my mistress in. If she does the same thing I'll be just as upset with her. I begin to realize it's not  them that's got me upset, it's what they've done to me that's got me upset. The reason that's valueable is because of this. I'm getting ready to start out on a lifetime changing process to develop the best possible relationship that I can with the world and everybody in it. So I can have maximum peace of mind and serenity. A part of that relationship is a little later on in my program, am I going to have to go around to a bunch of people and ask them to forgive me for what I've done to them. By the same token I'm going to have to forgive others for what they've done to me. And part of that forgiving process can start right here. When I begin to realize that it's not them, it's what they've done that got me upset. That starts getting names out of the way. It's going to make it a lot easier to handle this in the future. So I filled out two columns now. Number one, I learned how resentful I reall am, and how much that blocks me from God. Number two I learned that it's not them I resent, it's what they've done to me that I resent. 2 valuable things, now let's look at the third column.
</i>

**Bill (read by Joe)**: In most cases it was found that our self-esteem, our pocketbooks, our ambitions, our personal relationships, (including sex) were hurt or threatened. So we were sore. We were "burned up."

### Dealing with resentment (PLBB)

**Bill (read by Joe)**: On our grudge list we set opposite each name our injuries. Was it our self-esteem, our security, our ambitions, our personal, or sex relations, which had been interfered with?

We were usually as definite as this example:

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Resentful At</th>
<th>The Cause</th>
<th>Affects My</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Mr. Brown</td>
<td>His attention to my wife.</td>
<td>Sex relations, Self-esteem (fear)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>Told my wife of my mistress.</td>
<td>Sex relations, Self-esteem (fear)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>Brown may get my job at the office.</td>
<td>Security, Self-esteem (fear)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mrs. Jones</td>
<td>She's a nut--she snubbed me. She committed her husband for drinking. He's my friend. She's a gossip.</td>
<td>Personal relationship, Self-esteem (fear)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>My employer</td>
<td>Unreasonable--Unjust--Overbearing--Threatens to fire me for drinking and padding my expense account.</td>
<td>Security, Self-esteem (fear)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>My wife</td>
<td>Misunderstands and nags. Likes Brown. Wants house put in her name.</td>
<td>Pride, Personal, Sex relations, Security (fear)</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<i>**Joe**: And again using that information that we got from the basic instricts of life, we simply fill out the third column, what part of self was affected by that, what basic instinct was threatened by the actions that those people did?
</i>

<i>**Charlie**: I can't be upset with you unless you've done something to threaten one of these basic instincts of life. If you threaten my social instinct in any way--my self-esteem, my personal relations, etc.--you're going to upset me and make me angry. If you threaten my security, either  material or emotional, you're going to upset me and make me angry. If you threaten my sex life in any way, you're going to upset me and make me angry. 

And as I begin to fill out the third column and put down the part of self that is affected, in most cases I begin to see a pattern develop. Maybe beside each column I'll put "self-esteem", and maybe I begin to see my main problem is self-esteem. Maybe I'm putting down "security,"  and maybe I'm see where my main problem deals with security. Maybe I'm putting something under "sex" each time, and I begin to realize that the sex thing is my main problem. 

I begin to see which part of self really does stand out. It's probably going to be a combination of all three. But I can certainly see which part of self really does predominate and stand out when I keep seeing it appear over and over and over again. 

When I filled out the third column, here's where I've learned something that I think is the most valuable thing I ever learned about me. When I filled out the third column for the first time in my life, I could see where anger comes from. I've always had a problem with anger. I've always acted and reacted with anger, I did things that hurt other people. I would be ashamed of it. I said "I'll never do that again." Then I'd turn right around, and get angry, and do it all over again. 

You can't do anything about a problem until you understand the problem. I never did understand where anger came from. I always thought it was just one of those feelings that flitted into your mind--you could do nothing about it. Today, I realize that anger comes from a threat to one of these basic instincts of life. 

Now, if my basic instincts are under control at the level that God intended--if my relationship with God is okay--then you can do anything you want to with me, and I'm not going to experience anger over it. I guarentee you, if my instincts are out of control, then my relationship with God is not right. Just about anything that you do to me that threatens a basic instinct creates anger. And I romp and stomp  and raise hell with you and everybody around you. 

You know, this lady that I'm married to today--hopefully I can introduce you to her tomorrow--she's here with us this weekend. A beautiful lady named Barbara. If there's any such thing as a black-belt Al-Anon, she's one of them. She's got now about 31 or 32 years in the Al-Anon fellowship. Great, great program. 

But Barbara is like all human beings--she has self-will too. Now, once in a great while she'll get sick in self. Al-Anons do that too once in awhile--not too often, but once in a while. She'll do something that threatens one of my basic instincts of life. And when she does it, it hurts.

Now, I've found if my relationship with God is right, and my instincts are at the level God intended, I'm able to say, "Well, the poor old thing. They're sick just like we are. They can't help it any more than we can." And that thing will just slide off of my back, and it won't bother me at all. I just go on about my business. 

Thirty days later, though, the same lady does the same thing--only this time my instincts are not under control, and my relationship with God is not right today--and I react to what she did with anger.
</i>

<i>**Charlie**: And I romp and I stomp and I raise hell with Barbara and everybody around me all day long. The same lady did the same thing, but I choose to react to it in an entirely different manner based upon my relationship with God and where my instincts are that day. Thank God I've learned that. Because you see I can't do anything about Barbara. I can't do anything about any other human being on Earth, but I can do something about my relationship with God, and keeping my instincts under control where I don't have to get angry. And if I don't have to get angry, then I am in much less chance of drinking than if I continue that anger over and over and over. Thank God I learned that, one of the best pieces of information I ever found. Now we have filled out 3 columns. Column 1 we listed the people who we were angry with, "Resentful At." And we realized how resentful we really are, and how much that blocks us off from the sunlight of the spirit. Column 2 we've learned that it's not them we are resentful at, it's what they've done to us. Column 3, it's not even what they've done to us, it's how we choose to react to it based on our relationship with God, and whether our instincts are under control or not. We're going to fill out a couple of names here from our inventories, we're not going to do the whole thing, but just 2 or 3 names as an example. The first name on my sheet, was this lady named Barbara.

<hr/>

<i>**Charlie**: Thirty some odd years ago, I hated this lady with a purple passion. If I could have done away with her and not get caught I believe I would have done it. I used to lay awake at night fantisizing about this thing. Tomorrow morning when she's on the way to work, and the way she always worked I believed in her being self-supporting through her own contributions. Always thinking of others. Tomorrow morning when she's on the way to work she's going to get run over by a big semi truck. And it's not going to be just any trucking company, it's going to be a very affluent trucking company, and they're going to run over her and kill her, and then I'm going to sue them, and I'm going to come out of this deal getting rid of her, with 2 or 3 million dollars in hand. You Al-Anons are not the only ones that fantasize, we alkies did it too, believe me we did. Second name on my sheet was the I.R.S. God I hated those people with a purple passion. Just mention their name I begin to froth at the mouth immediately. Joe what was the first name on your inventory sheet?
</i>

<i>**Joe**: Rose
</i>

<i>**Charlie**: Rose. Wife number one, Rose. Now it's just that simple that's how you fill out the first column. We go to the second column. Why am I so upset with Barbara. Last year, before she went down to Al-Anon, She had the audacity to file for divorce, three times. She spending more money on divorces, than I'm spending on booze and everything that goes with it. And By God I hated her for that. Why am I so upset with the I.R.S. well, they're trying to put me in jail, that's why. Joe? How come you're so upset with Rose?
</i>

<i>**Joe**: She had an affair with another man, after all I've done for her.
</i>

<i>**Charlie**: She had an affair with another man. Really upset with her. Now we go to the third column. Barbara filing for divorce three times is that a threat to my self-esteem, oh you betcha. What are people going to think of me now taking this lady back after she's filed for divorce three times. Barbara filing for divorce for three times, is that a threat to my personal relationships. Sure it is. She's going to take the kids and she's going to leave, or they're going to kick me out, one of the two. No personal relationships. Her filing for divorce three times is that a threat to my security oh yeah, by the time she's through she's going to have it all, don't worry about that. Is it a threat to my sex life. Oh yeah, she probably won't let me have any sex if we get a divorce. I.R.S. trying to put me in jail is that a threat to me self-esteem? What are people going to think about me after this deal is over with. Is it a threat to my personal relationships? They're not going to let me have any relationship with my wife and children if I'm in jail. Is it a threat to my security, oh yeah, they're going to take every penny I've got by the time it's over with. Is it a threat to my sex life? The kind I'd like to have you betcha it's a threat to it there may be some in there I don't want. Old Rose having an affair with another man is that a threat to Joe's self-esteem? Is it a threat to his personal relationships? Is it a threat to his security? Yeah, he'll have to go to work now she's been supporting him for the last 10 years. A threat to his sex life, oh yeah. All these things are threats to those things. Okay, when we have finished filling out these three columns and we've been able to see column 1, how many resentments we had, column two the cause of the resentment, column three the part of self that was affected, and we've learned valuable information about ourselves. Just by filling out those 3 columns, now let's see what we do with those 3 columns, after we've filled them out. Joe?
</i>

**Bill (read by Joe)**: <span class="bg-direction">We went back through our lives. Nothing counted but thoroughness and honesty. When we were finished we considered it carefully.</span> <span class="bg-warning">The first thing apparent was that this world and its people were often quite wrong. To conclude that others were wrong was as far as most of us ever got.</span> 

<i>**Joe**: I always knew that.</i>

**Bill (read by Joe)**: <span class="bg-warning">The usual outcome was that people continued to wrong us and we stayed sore. Sometimes it was remorse and then we were sore at ourselves. But the more we fought and tried to have our own way, the worse matters got. As in war, the victor only SEEMED to win. Our moments of triumph were short-lived.</span>

**Bill (read by Joe)**: It is plain that a life which includes deep resentment leads only to futility and unhappiness. To the precise extent that we permit these, do we squander the hours that might have been worth while. 

<i>**Charlie**: When I read that last statement, and I stopped and I tried to look back in my life and see. How much time I've squandered in resentments. I don't know about you, but I know about me, when I've got a good resentment up there churning around in my head I'm pretty well paralyzed from doing anything worthwhile. And one of my favorite things that I was doing back when I was drinking was to get up early in the morning, have a drink of whiskey and a cup of coffee. And turn on my resentment replay machine, and replay what she did to me yesterday, and replay what the guy did to me a month ago, and replay what that person said to me six months ago, and replay what that damn boss did to me about a year ago, and replay what that damn policeman did to me five years ago, and replay what my uncle did to me ten years ago, and replay what my mother did to me 15 years ago, and replay what my father did to me 20 years ago, and it took me just about an hour to run through that tape and I loved every moment of it. When that tape would run out I'd have another drink of whiskey and another cup of coffee, and I would turn on my get even machine. Now by God the next time she does that, I'll do this and she'll do that ??? I'll put it on her they're not going to treat me that way and it took me just about an hour to run through that tape and I loved every moment of it. When I came into A.A. I found out that the only difference was I wasn't taking the drink of whiskey I was having a cup of coffee, turning on my resentment replay machine run it for an hour another cup of coffee, turning on the get even machine, run it for an hour. I have spent literally thousands and thousands of hours of resentments. And as far as I can tell, they've never done me any good whatsoever. They certainly never made me any money. They never made me feel better. They only made me feel worse. They never straightened out a relationship with another  human being, they only made it worse and worse and worse. And as far as I can tell that was absolute complete waste of time. Now as a human being I really believe  today that I'm allotted just so much time to be here on Earth. And I'm being to approach the end of mine. And for the first time in my life, not only am I sober, but I am peaceful happy and free. For the first time in my life, I'm sober, and I feel great. I didn't know that you could be sober and feel as good as I feel today. What little time that I have left I want to enjoy every moment of it. I don't want to waste any more time in resentments or anything else because that blocks me off from God, I want to enjoy every moment of every day that I have left. I simply do not intend to waste any more time in resentments. They block you off from God. They block you off from your fellow man. They just make you sicker and sicker and sicker. What time we spend on them is an absolute waste of time. That's one of the worst things about a resentment, wasting time we have left on resentments. But that's not the worst thing, here's the worst thing about a resentment said
</i>

**Bill (read by Joe)**: But with the alcoholic, whose hope is the maintenance and growth of a spiritual experience, this business of resentment is infinitely grave. We found that it is fatal. For when harboring such feeling we shut ourselves off from the sunlight of the Spirit. The insanity of alcohol returns and we drink again. And with us, to drink is to die.

<i>**Charlie**: That's the worst thing about a resentment. When we've got a good resentment churning around in our head we don't feel good we're blocked off from God, and after a while the mind, wanting to feel better begins to think about the sense of ease and comfort that comes at once by taking a couple of drinks, next thing we know we become insane we convince ourselves that it's okay to drink. We take a drink, and we trigger the allergy and we end up drunk all over again. That's the worst part about a resentment. The book says
</i>

**Bill (read by Charlie)**: If we were to live, we had to be free of anger. The grouch and the brainstorm were not for us. They may be the dubious luxury of normal men, but for alcoholics these things are poison.

<span class="bg-direction">We turned back to the list,</span>

<i>**Charlie**: You see this is why you've got to have a written inventory. If you had it in your head, you would have lost it already.
</i>


**Bill (read by Charlie)**: <span class="text-muted">We turned back to the list,</span> <span class="bg-direction">for it held the key to the future. We were prepared to look for it from an entirely different angle. 

<i>**Charlie**: Always before when I looked at it to see what those suckers had done to me. Today I would look at it to see what that resentment is doing to me. And if it's blocking me off from God, maybe causing me to get drunk. Then I'm looking at it from an entirely different angle.
</i>

**Bill (read by Charlie)**: We began to see that the world and its people really dominated us.</span> <span class="bg-warning">In that state, the wrong-doing of others, fancied or real, had power to actually kill.</span> 

<i>**Charlie**: And I stopped and I said, "Charlie, how dumb can you be?" All my life I've been proud that I stand on my own two feet. Nobody tells me what to do. I don't need your advice. Thank you. And I suddently realized that other people, through my resentment toward them, have controlled and dominated my thinking, as far back as I could remember. And if they've controlled and dominated my thinking they've controlled and dominated my actions, they've absolutely and completely controlled and dominated my entire life for me. I always thought I was in charge. But I suddently realized other people have been in charge as far back as I can remember through my resentments toward them. And then I said, "You really are stupid, aren't you?" Because some of these people have been dead and buried in the grave yard for years. And they've been reaching out from the grave. And they've had me by the yang-yang as far back as I can remember. And when I saw that I said, "To hell with them. I'm not going to let those people, alive or dead, live in my head, rent free, any longer." I made a decision to let God direct my thinking. And if others direct it alive or dead, justified or unjustified, then God can't, and it's just that simple. An amazing thing happened to me right here. We alcoholics fancy ourselves as reasonably intelligent people. I don't know that we're smarter than anybody else, but we're reasonably intelligent people, and we don't like to look stupid. And when I saw the stupidity of letting those people control me and dominate me, it looked so dumb that about 95% of these resentments began to disappear automatically. When I saw how stupid that really was. But I found I had 4, 5, 6 that were so deeply embedded in my mind for so long, that they didn't automatically disappear when I saw the stupidity behind them. For those I had to have some additional help. We now come to the first prayer in Step Four. We've heard about the Step 3, the Step 7 prayers, we never heard about the Step Four Prayer. Let's see how we can use prayer to remove those deep, deep seated resentments.
</i>

**Bill (read by Joe)**: How could we escape? We saw that these resentments must be mastered, but how? We could not wish them away any more than alcohol.

<i>**Joe**: You can't heal a sick mind with a sick mind. You can't wish your way out of it.
</i>

**Bill (read by Joe)**: This was our course: <span class="bg-direction">We realized that the people who wronged us were perhaps spiritually sick.</span> <span class="bg-warning">Though we did not like their symptoms and the way these disturbed us, they, like ourselves, were sick too.</span> 

<i>**Joe**: This is part of the prayer.
</i>

<span class="bg-prayer">We asked God to help us show them the same tolerance, pity, and patience that we would cheerfully grant a sick friend.</span> <span class="bg-direction">When a person offended we said to ourselves, "This is a sick man. How can I be helpful to him? God save me from being angry. Thy will be done."</span>

<i>**Joe**: And I'm like Charlie, I've spent many, many years of my life thinking my mind was racing uncontrollably. Trying to figure out some way of getting even with those people, and I finally figured out how to get even with them. Well the way you get even with people is you pray for them. And when you pray for them, then you're even, and I didn't know that. And after I was sober about 3 or 4 months, I went to a little conference in Apache, OK. There was alady there named Alabam Cathy some of yall knew Alabam she had a big influence on my life and she said a couple of things that night that really struck me. She said she had a soul-sickness. and I could identify with that. My last night of drinking I was sitting on a barstool and I had a real sick feeling in my stomach and it wasn't throwing up time sick it was sick feeling, she said she had a soul-sickness, that's what I had, a soul-sickness. She said another thing that night, she said "I have peace of mind today" And boy that really struck me, because that's all I ever wanted . I loved Alabam, she was always excitied about life and what was going to happen next  and after the meeting was over with we were sitting around in the lobby of this hotel and it was about 3:00 am, and I was sitting there watching Alabam operate and she wasn't saying anything, it was just Alabam and myself and a little sponsor George, little black guy laying in her lap and begin to talk to Alabam. I said "How do you get peace of mind, I want peace of mind." She said Joe tell me what's going on in your mind, I told her I was going to meetings and going to meetings. But at night I would go home, and lay down in my mind and I would begin to think about all those situations that we talked about. She said "Joe, you're just full of resentments." And I said "What is a resentment?" She said a resentment was old angers and old hurts that are re-felt over and over again, and all that anger they you intended to use up on them, you're turning it on yourself. Making yourself sick, and blaming it on them. She explained that to me and it took a while for me to understand finally I did, and I said "Is there any solutions for these?" And she said "Yes there is, just happens to be" and she referred to page 67 and showed me this information here, and she said some of those deep-seated resentments that you have you'll need some additional help. She said of page 551 of this book is a story of a lady who had those deep-seated resentments. If you turn to that page in the book she said we'll read and see what it had to say. Well Alabam had a purse about this big, and she began to look in that purse. You know how they are, digging around. And she finally found one of these books. She pulled it out of there, and said, "Let's look at page 551 and see what it says." So I turned to page 551 in her book, and on the third paragraph.

[^wynn]: **Andrew**: Excerpt from "Freedom from Bondage" by Wynn L.

<blockquote>
**Wynn (read by Joe)**: I’ve[^wynn] had many spiritual experiences since I’ve been in the program, many that I didn’t recognize right away, for I’m slow to learn and they take many guises. But one was so outstanding that I like to pass it on whenever I can in the hope that it will help someone else as it has me. As I said earlier, self-pity and resentment were my constant companions and my inventory began to look like a thirty-three year diary, for I seemed to have a resentment against everybody I had ever known. All but one “responded to the treatment” suggested in the Steps immediately, but this one posed a problem.

<i>**Charlie**: All but one automatically began to disappear when she saw how dumb they really were.
</i>

**Wynn (read by Joe)**: It was against my mother and it was twenty-five years old. I had fed it, fanned it and nurtured it as one might a delicate child, and it had become as much a part of me as my breathing. It had provided me with excuses for my lack of education, my marital failures, personal failures, inadequacy, and of course, my alcoholism and, though I really thought I had been willing to part with it, now I knew I was reluctant to let it go.

**Wynn (read by Joe)**: One morning, however, I realized I had to get rid of it, for my reprieve was running out, and if I didn’t get rid of it I was going to get drunk—and I didn’t want to get drunk any more. In my prayers that morning I asked God to point out to me some way to be free of this resentment. During the day a friend of mine brought me some magazines to take to a hospital group I was interested in, and I looked through them and a “banner” across the front of one featured an article by a prominent clergyman in which I caught the word “resentment.”

**Wynn (read by Joe)**: He said, in effect: “If you have a resentment you want to be free of, if you will pray for the person or the thing that you resent, you will be free. If you will ask in prayer for everything you want for yourself to be given to them, you will be free. Ask for their health, their prosperity, their happiness, and you will be free. Even when you don’t really want it for them, and your prayers are only words and you don’t mean it, go ahead and do it anyway. Do it every day for two weeks and you will find you have come to mean it and to want it for them, and you will realize that where you used to feel bitterness and resentment and hatred, you now feel compassionate understanding and love.”
</i>
<br/>-- (A.A., p. 551, "Freedom from Bondage.")
</blockquote>

<i>**Joe**: Well I went home after that meeting and got in my bed that Sunday night lay down any my old mind fipped over again and started racing uncontrollably, so I said I think I'll pray for those people. I started praying for those people that night and my list got longer
the next day I prayed for those people again
that afternoon I prayed for those people
that night I prayed for those people
and I don't know how long it was 2 or 3 weeks or more I don't know, but it seemed like I was in constant prayer for day and night praying for those people
I don't know exactly what happened but I do know that one morning it was one of those beautiful spring mornings we have in Oklahoma. I got stuck at this stoplight just the length of a stoplight--that's what happened--I looked over at that beautiful house sitting over there, and the grass was so green it was just beautiful, the greenest green I've ever seen, the tulips were in full bloom red and yellow. The little squirrels were in the trees the birds were in the trees whistling, and it was just a beautiful morning. I thought to myself, by God, how long has it been since I've seen that you know I could not remember. I could not remember. When this book talks about being cut off from the sunlight of the spirit I really do know what that means I really do. Because that morning it was so vivid.

Now what happened was that those people did not change but my thoughts and feelings toward them did change. You see, and has never returned again. Thank God for this program called Alcoholics Anonymous. Now I've been there, and I don't want to ever return again.
</i>

<i>**Charlie**: I think the reason this works so well is that prayer for another human being--prayer for their welfare and their happiness--it's probably one of the greatest expressions of love that one human being can have for another. Love and hate can't exist on the same plane. As we pray for that human being, asking that God give them in their life the same thing we want in ours--peace of mind, serenity, happiness, etc.--over a period of time that resentment will begin to disappear. 

Sometimes it just takes two or three prayers. Sometimes it takes every day for two weeks. Sometimes it might take every day for two months. But if we will consistently do it, we will find sooner or later that that resentment is replaced with love and the resentment disappears. 

Now, if you've got a resentment that you don't want to get rid of, for God's sake don't pray about them. Because if you do, then you're going to lose it. I know--I speak from experience. I had a guy that I really, really resented. And again, I think I would gladly have put him away if I could have gotten away with it without getting caught.

When I got to this part of the inventory, I went to my sponsor. Now this is going to be one of those "take it to the grave" resentments. I had no desire to remove it at all. And I'd worked on all of the others, but this one just stuck in there. 

I went to my sponsor, and I told him about it. He said, "Charlie, you've got to get rid of that resentment." I said, "I don't want to get rid of this resentment." He said, "Well that's besides the point. If you don't get rid of it, sooner or later it's going to get you drunk." And in my smart mouth I said, "Well, how the hell do I do it?" And he said, "Let me show you." And he took me to this prayer too. He said, "Now read that and go home, and do what it says, and you'll get rid of that resentment."

I went home and got on my knees--which again I very seldom did in those days--and I said, "God, I want you to give that S.O.B. everything he deserves." And that's the only prayer I had for him that day. 

I prayed again and again and again. Three or four or five days later--I don't know when--I found myself saying something that I didn't really mean to say. I found myself saying, "God, give him in his life what I want in mine--the same peace of mind, serenity, and happiness that I seek for myself."

Four or five or six or seven days later--I don't know when--I woke up one morning and that resentment was gone. Completely gone. And it's never returned since that date. 

I think the irony in the whole situation is that it wasn't 30 days later, this guy moved in as my next-door neighbor. This thing really does work.

<i>**Charlie**: Now, just think, this old head up here that these display cases over here were filled with resentments has now been emptied out. The resentments--the damaged and unsaleable goods--called resentment has now been removed from my mind. Now when that happens to me there's another natural law that applies that says nature abhors a vacuum. There's no such thing as a vacuum or void there's always something trying to rush in and fill it up. If those resentments disappear, God's not going to leave another hole in my head, I got enough of those already. They will have to be replaced with something else, and the only thing that can replace them will be the opposite of them. Where my mind used to be filled with resentments that portion of it is now filled with love, patience, tolerance, compassion, and goodwill toward my fellow man. That's God's thinking my thinking was the resentment God's thinking is love, patience, tolerance, compassion and goodwill. And that part of my mind is now filled with God's thinking. You see, there's nothing negative here at all. This is a positive happening. In part of my mind, I've now got peace of mind, serenity and happiness. Much less chance of drinking now than when I started the inventory process. What really blew my mind is this I didn't have to go to any other fellowships and I didn't have to read any other books to find love, patience, tolerance, compassion and goodwill. If God dwells within me, and my book says he does, and that's always been a part of my makeup. I just never could use it before in my chase for money power, prestige, sex, and what I thought were the good things of life. Those thoughts had to be repressed to let me operate on the level I wanted to operate on. But now that resentments are gone they automatically come to the surface. I've never seen anything like this before I don't really understand how this works I simply know that if do the simple things the book tells me to do this happens automatically and resentments are replaced with love, patience, tolerance, compassion and goodwill toward my fellow man. But it would do me no good to get rid of resentments if I didn't know how to keep them from coming back. Because the world is full of sick people. They're going to do it to me again tomorrow. If I'm not careful I'll resent, and it seemed as though I don't get just one. When I get one let me play with it just a little bit and then I've got two. Let me play with those two, and then I've got 10. The next thing you know I'm a basket case and I'm sick all over again. I've got to do one more thing let's unfold those last two columns on your inventory sheet. Let's go to page 67 and we'll see if we can't find the information to fill out the last two columns.

<i>**Charlie**: In the second paragraph on page 67, it says
</i>

<p class="text-muted">We avoid retaliation or argument. We wouldn't treat sick people that way. If we do, we destroy our chance of being helpful. We cannot be helpful to all people, but at least God will show us how to take a kindly and tolerant view of each and every one.</p>

**Bill (read by Charlie)**: Referring to our list again. 

<i>**Charlie**: So you gotta have a written inventory. This is the second time we've had to go back to it. 
</i>

**Bill (read by Charlie)**: <span class="text-muted">Referring to our list again.</span>

Putting out of our minds the wrongs others had done, we resolutely looked for our own mistakes. 


<i>**Charlie**: Uh, oh. We've never done this, have we? We've always looked to see what they did. We've never looked to see what we did.
</i>

Where had we been selfish (`A2`), dishonest (`A1`), self-seeking (`A2`) and frightened (`A3`)? Though a situation had not been entirely our fault, we tried to disregard the other person involved entirely. Where were we to blame? The inventory was ours, not the other man's. When we saw our faults we listed them. We placed them before us in black and white. We admitted our wrongs honestly and were willing to set these matters straight.

<i>**Charlie**: So we go to the fourth column. And if you'll noticed the heading on the fourth column, it says, "What did I do?"
</i>

**Bill (read by Charlie)**: <p class="text-muted">Putting out of our minds the wrongs others had done, we resolutely looked for our own mistakes.</p>

<i>**Charlie**: What if anything did I do to set in motion trains of circumstances which in turn caused people or institutions to hurt me and eventually led to my resentment of them for doing so? So I went to column 4. And I looked at this lady named Barbara. And I said, "Now, Charlie, you forget what she did. You forget her filing for three divorces. What if anything did you do to set that in motion?" And it took me just about 5 seconds to realize that if I hadn't been out there screwing around she probably wouldn't have caught me. And she probably wouldn't have filed for divorce in the first place. Took me another 2 or 3 seconds to say to myself, "Well, if I hadn't been sneaking around behind her back lying to her all the time--completely dishonest with her--she probably wouldn't have filed for divorce in the first place." Another 3 or 4 seconds and I was able to say for myself, "Well, If I wasn't blowing all of our money on booze and what I think was important, she probably wouldn't have filed for divorce in the first place." And I began to realize why I love that resentment. Because when I could concentrate on her filing for divorce, and play that over and over and over in my head. Gradually distorting the picture every time I played it over. Making what she did a little bit worse, and what I did a little bit less. And let me play it long enough I could gradually transfer all blame to her and make myself as pure as the driven snow. And it was all her damn fault in the first place. I thought, "My God, Charlie, have you done that with any other resentments here?" I looked at the I.R.S. I said, "Forget what they're doing to you trying to put you in jail. What did you do if anything to set in motion the fact that they're trying to put you in jail?" Well it didn't take 2 seconds to say, "Well if I hadn't been cheating on my income tax, they wouldn't have been trying to put me in jail anyhow." And rather than look at what I had done to them, I had played it over and over and over. Distorted the picture and transferred all blame to them, made myself as pure as the driven snow. That way I could continue through life doing what I wanted to do and never have to look at me, because after all it's all their fault in the first place. Joe's resentment against Rose, what did you do if anything to set that in motion?
</i>

<i>**Joe**: Charlie was out there screwing around, but I was committing adultery
</i>

<i>**Charlie**: Okay. Sneaking around behind their back and lying to her all the time, and Rose finally got enough ot it. She said, "I'll show him." And she went out and had her own affair. And Joe over a period of time, played that resentment over and over. Gradually transfered all blame to her, made himself as pure as the driven snow. I went down through my list of resentments. I never found a name on there that I hadn't done something to them to set this thing in motion and I had resented it and played it over and over and distorted the picture transferred all blame to them made myself as pure as the driven snow. If you're a practicing alcoholic you've got to develop these kind of skills. You know we have a conscience we're not drunken bumb so we know the difference between right and wrong. And I don't think we could live with ourselves if we had to honestly see what was going on whenever we're out there doing our thing but you see we never have to see it because we've got this convinient thing called resentments that we play them over and over distort the picture and transfer all blame to others and we men go from woman to woman to woman. And you ladies go from man to man to man. And we go from job to job to job. And we go from city to city to city. And we go from country to country to country. And it's always their damn fault. That's the only way we would live the kind of life we were living--by being able to transfer blame to others and none of us realize how much we've been doing that until we take an honest look at these resentments and see the part that we played.
</i>

<i>**Charlie**: Now in the fifth column you see the major character defects talked about in the Big Book:
 
Where had I been selfish (`A2`), self-seeking (`A2`), frightened (`A3`), inconsiderate (`A2`)

All other character defects stem from these. In the fifth column I asked myself this question. "Which of the above character defects caused me to do what I did?" Or caused me to want to hold on to the old resentment even though I may have done nothing to cause it. Now going back to Barbara again, if I hadn't have been so selfish, I wouldn't have been out there doing those things to hurt my wife and children. If I hadn't have been so dishonest I wouldn't have been sneaking around behind her back lying to her all the time. If I hadn't been so self-seeking and frightened and saying to myself, "Man you're getting close to 40 years old if you're ever going to do some of that you better go do it before it's too late." Fear drives us to do things like that. If I hadn't been so inconsiderate of my wife and children I wouldn't have been taking the chance of hurting them in the first place. I begin to see in the fifth column, the type of character I had become, through my years of living a life run on self-will and when I saw it I didn't like it. It made me sick. You see I always fancied myself as a reasonably good person, until I saw how I had become so selfish and so dishonest and so inconsiderate of other people that I was continually doing things to hurt others, and they retaliated and I resented for it. I begin to see that if I don't change those things in the fifth column, if I stay selfish, dishonest, self-seeking and inconsiderate, then I'm going to go on doing the same old things I've always done, drunk or sober. I'm going right on hurting people, and they're going to retaliate, and I'm giong to resent, and eventually it's going to block me off from God and I'm going to get drunk over it. But just think, if I could become a little less selfish, oh I don't have to get perfect, I never will, but if I could become a little less selfish, if I could become a little less dishonest, if I could become less frightened and self-seeking, if I could become a little more considerate of other perople and their needs and their wants, then maybe I wouldn't have to do some of that kind of stuff. Maybe I wouldn't hurt people and maybe they wouldn't retaliate, and I wuoldn't have to resent. And just maybe I wouldn't have to get drunk over it. You see what we're really doing here this is the resentment part of it. But out in the fifth column I now see the exact nature of the wrongs. That I'm going to talk to another human being about when I take Step Five. The resentment is the wrong. That's what blocks me off from God, but what's the exact nature of it, that means what's the truth of it? What's at the core of it what's the inherent characteristic of it? That's what we'll talk about in Step Five. When a guy comes to me and he's committed adultery 44 times I don't care about that. All I want to know is what is within him that caused him to do it in the first place. If he's stolen 364 times I don't care about that what I want to know is what's within him that caused him to do that. That's what we'll talk about in Step Five. In that fifth column I now see the and I'm going to become willing to turn loose of in Step Six. Out there in the fifth column I see the shortcomings now I'm going to ask God to take away in Step Seven. And in my case all the names from column one came off of this sheet to be added to the sheet later to be used for steps 8 and 9. Because you see when I get to Step 8 it says I've got the list, I made it when I took Step Four. In my case every one of those, in your case probably some of them, in my case all of them. Now what I've really done if I have done this the way the Big Book says is I have prepared myself with all the information I need for Steps 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 resentment-wise. Not only have I gathered all the information I need for 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. Well I've had a positive result here. Resentments have disappeared and they've been replaced with love, patience, tolerance, compassion and goodwill. Did we do anything to be afraid of? Did we make a list of dirty, filthy, nasty items? No. Did we do anything that was too complicated? No. I've never seen anything like this inventory according to the Big Book. Now I hear some of you saying and I hear awful good, I've got good hearing. 
</i>

<i>**Joe**: Charlie hears good.
</i>

<i>**Charlie**: And I hear some of you saying, well, Charlie that's probably right on those that we did something to them, but how about those that did it to us, and we didn't have anything to do with that. How about those that hurt us as kids growing up. How about those that hurt us in our marriages that we didn't do anything to cause it. Aren't we justified in having that kind of resentment. Well I guess we are if we want to get drunk over it. But you see a justified resentment blocks you off from God just like an unjustified resentment does. When you've got a justified resentment churning around in your head then whoever or whatever you're resenting is controlling your thinking. If they're controlling your thinking, then they're controlling decisions, they're controlling your life for you. And you've given them power to actually kill you because you have given them power to cause you to get drunk again. Not if you've got one of those resentments, and I don't care what it is I don't care whether it's physical abuse, mental abuse, sexual abuse, or whatever. And I keep hearing a n all the time sexual abuse thing usually centers on young women but let me tell you something men know about that too. I don't know how many fifth steps I've taken with men and nearly every one of us somewhere in our background we've had that kind of stuff too it's not just women it's men. If you've got one of those kind of resentments and you don't want to get rid of it knowing full well it might get you drunk, then we better get it on this sheet of paper and take a look at it and see what we're doing with it and we're probably using it for rationalization and justification to rationalize not doing things we ought to go do or just as importantly to rationalize and justify doing things that we shouldn't be doing in the first place. Oh the greatest excuse in the world is if they hadn't have done that to me and I wouldn't hvae to be the way I am today they call that victimization. Now I don't really think we got any place for that in A.A. we're all adults it's time for us to realize that whatever's happened to us in the past does not have to control what we do today. You know the only reason for that is to justify, rationalize, etc. The woman in the book she used her resentment againts her mother to justify her lack of education. Bull. She could have gotten an education if she wanted it bad enough. She used it t ojustify her marital failure. Bull. Mama didn't have anything to do with their marital failure. She even used it to justify her alcoholism. Mama had nothing to do with her alcoholism. She became an alcoholic because she drank whiskey then she drank enough of it she became alcoholic and I think it's time for us to realize we are responsible what we think and how we feel we are responsible for what we do today mother and daddy and other people are no longer responsible for that. Maybe they were and we're little kids but we're not little kids any longer. It really doesn't make any sense to let somebody hurt me 5, 10, 15, 20 years ago and let them hurt me every day for the rest of my life if I'm resenting them they've got me and they're gonna kill me I need to put them on this sheet put down their name what did they do to me, what part of self is affected, what did I do if anything to set in motion, in this case nothing, but then let's look in the fourth column. Are we so dishonest with ourselves we refuse to see the truth. If you've got a resentment in your head, today it's not true, and we'll say that again. If you've got a resentment in your head today, it's not true. No. It was based on truth and it's partially true, but if you've played it over and over and over you've distored it and it's no longer true. Can we honestly look at it and see the truth behind it. Let's look at the fifth column and see if maybe we are so afraid or frightened of facing life without it we refuse to turn it loose because you know after all if we turn it loose and we've got to take responsibliity for our own behavior to help a lot easier to blame it on others now we suffer to feel afraid of facing life without it we won't turn it loose are we so inconsiderate of another human being and we fail to recognize that people that do those things to us they're not necessarily bad people they're sick people. They didn't necessarily do it to us they would have done it to anybody in that position. If we could even begin to consider that maybe we can start a forgiving process. Maybe we could straighten up a relationship with another human being and before it's too late after they're dead it's too late. I'll guarantee you it is maybe we can do it while we're all still alive if we will do those things I think we can get rid of that resentment too when we really see the truth behind it and what we're diong with it if we can't get rid of it that way then we can use the ultimate tool by golly we can pray for them, and if we pray for one of those people resentment doesn't mean that we approve of what they did that doesn't mean we're going to take them by hand and walk hand in hand with them for the rest of our lives, what it means is we're tired of letting them control us dominate us and rule us every day for the rest of our life we can get rid of those kind of resentments too and if we don't want to do that then chances are we're using it for some reason and we need to look at it very, very carefully. Joe?
</i>

<i>**Joe**: Takes two people to make a prison. The prisoner and the jailer. You have to let them out and turn them loose. All those people who I hated. I had to turn them loose. Charlie said, "I don't want to be a victim anymore." Alcoholics Anonymous may be the only association left on the face of the Earth that is more allow us to be victims. There's victims going on all out there everybody wants to be a victim of something. But we in A.A. won't let each other do that because we have a way out. We can pray for them. They need the prayers and we need the practice. 
</i>

<i>**Charlie**: You know I see in many A.A. meetings where we've gone into this group therapy stuff. And we sit around the table and we discuss what those people did to us. And we try to figure out why they did it. We'll never understand why they did it. The thing is they did it. Then we start trying to discuss and figure out why it made us the way we are. We'll never understand that. The fact is that's the way we are. The real question is what are we going to do about it? Are we going to continue letting them kill us? Or are we going to get rid of that Jazz. That's what A.A. is about. It's not to sit around and talk about problems. It's about how do you sit around and talk about how do you solve the problems. And resentment is the number one problem for every alcoholic. And if we can get rid of them, then we're peaceful, happy and free. Until we do, we'll never be free of it. We went through a process yesterday afternoon the first part of the inventory process. There we learned how to look at our resentments to take an honest truthful, moral inventory. And as we listed those resentments, we began to see the truth about them, really. The first thing we saw in column one was how many resentments we really did have, and how much that blocked us off from the sunlight of the Spirit. The second things we saw in column two was it's not the people or institutions we resent, it's what they've done to us that we actually resent. The third thing we found out in column 3 it's really not even what they've done to us it's how we choose to react to a threat to one of our basic instincts of life, which is going to determine whether we are going to be resentful or not. So just in filling out those three columns learned some very valuable information. We were also able to see in the Big Book that resentments was an absolute waste of time. And whenever they're churning around in our heads we're pretty well paralyzed from doing anything worthwhile. And we found that if we honestly look at them, most of us have spent literally thousands and thousands of hours in resentments, and as we look back at that time in our lives, we found they really never did do us any good. They never really straightened out a relationship with another human being, never made us feel better, only made us feel worse, never made us any money for sure, and as far as we can tell, it's an absolute waste of time. We also said that's not the worst thing about resentments. The worst thing about a resentment is that it effectively blocks us off from God, Blocked off from God, we don't feel good, we begin to become insane, we begin to think about taking a drink, we end up drunk all over again. And when we truthfully and honestly looked at those resentments, we could really begin to see how other people have controlled and dominated us throughout our entire lifetime through those resentments. We always thought that we had it under control, that we determined what we said and what we did, but we suddently realized that we really have done nothing but react to others through our resentment toward them. That looked so stupid to us that about 95% of those resentments automatically disappeared. The other 5% that was so deeply embedded we found through prayer that we could remove them also. So we could be resentment free if we follow the procedures outlined in the Big Book. The real revealing thing is the amazing thing is that after we became resentment-free God wouldn't allow another hole in our head, it had to be replaced with something else, the only thing that could replace it is the opposite of resentment. And where we used to feel resentment we now feel serenity, a little peace of mind, a little happiness, compassion good will love. Those are all God's thinking, rather than our individual thinking. And we found that that came to us automatically. Those things that have always been a part of us, we just never could use them before. Now the resentments are gone then God's thinking automatically begins to replace the resentment, and we're much less chance of getting drunk now than when we started the process. We went back to the resentment sheet, and we looked at it from an entirely different angle now.

### Fear hides everywhere (PLBB)

Notice that the word "fear" is bracketed alongside the difficulties with Mr. Brown, Mrs. Jones, the employer, and the wife. This short word somehow touches about every aspect of our lives. It was an evil and corroding thread; the fabric of our existence was shot through with it. It set in motion trains of circumstances which brought us misfortune we felt we didn't deserve. But did not we, ourselves, set the ball rolling? Sometimes we think fear ought to be classed with stealing. It seems to cause more trouble.

We reviewed our fears thoroughly. We put them on paper, even though we had no resentment in connection with them. We asked ourselves why we had them. Wasn't it because self-reliance failed us? Self-reliance was good as far as it went, but it didn't go far enough. Some of us once had great self-confidence, but it didn't fully solve the fear problem, or any other. When it made us cocky, it was worse.

Perhaps there is a better way--we think so. For we are now on a different basis; the basis of trusting and relying upon God. We trust infinite God rather than our finite selves. We are in the world to play the role He assigns. Just to the extent that we do as we think He would have us, and humbly rely on Him, does He enable us to match calamity with serenity.

We never apologize to anyone for depending upon our Creator. We can laugh at those who think spirituality the way of weakness. Paradoxically, it is the way of strength. The verdict of the ages is that faith means courage. All men of faith have courage. They trust their God. We never apologize for God. Instead we let Him demonstrate, through us, what He can do. We ask Him to remove our fear and direct our attention to what He would have us be. At once, we commence to outgrow fear.
