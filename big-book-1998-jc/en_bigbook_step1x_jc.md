### Step 10

<i>**Charlie**: Let's look at the last three steps, and not as just maintenance steps, not just to keep us sober but to see if we don't actually continue to grow in our relationship with God with ourselves and with other human beings. Twice in the book, Bill has mentioned a fourth dimension of existence. Once in his story, once in Chapter Two, a dimension of living far beyond the normal three. You can't explain it you can't describe it you can only feel it. And that's what the last three steps do--move us into another dimension of living. Let's look at them for just a few minutes.
</i>

<i>**Joe**: One of the things that we did as a fellowship is we took the steps out of the book and we put them on these little cards, put them on the wall and if you look at Step Ten on the card or on the wall by the way we left the instructions on how to work the steps in the book. People come into A.A. and look on the wall and try to work the steps off the wall without instructions. No wonder they get in trouble. Step Ten off the wall or on this card says 
</i>

<blockquote>
Continue to take personal inventory and when we were wrong promptly admitted it. 
</blockquote>

<i>**Joe**: It looked like if we just continued to take a little inventory and if we were wrong promptly admitted it, then we would be doing the intended step 10, and somehow we got the idea that we do that at night. Well the night time portion is over in Step Eleven, it's not in Step Ten. And Charlie and I have discussed this in great detail. We don't get in trouble at night in bed anymore. We need a day time walking around step. So let's look at Step Ten in a different light. 

**Bill (read by Joe)**: This thought brings us to Step Ten, which suggests we continue to take personal inventory and continue to set right any new mistakes as we go along. We vigorously commenced this way of living as we cleaned up the past. We have entered the world of the Spirit.

<i>**Charlie**: We've had a spiritual awakening.
</i>

**Bill (read by Joe)**: Our next function is to grow ...

<i>**Charlie**: To grow, not maintain, not to stay where we are, but to grow.
</i>

**Bill (read by Joe)**: ... in understanding and effectiveness. This is not an overnight matter. It should continue for our lifetime. Continue to watch for selfishness (`D601`), dishonesty (`D301`), resentment (`D203`), and fear (`D701`). 

<i>**Charlie**: What step did we take to look at that in the first place, anybody remember? Step Four. Okay.
</i>

When these crop up, we ask God at once to remove them. 

<i>**Charlie**: What steps did we use there? Six and Seven. Alright.
</i>

We discuss them with someone immediately 

<i>**Charlie**: What step was that? Five. Okay.
</i>

and make amends quickly if we have harmed anyone. 

<i>**Charlie**: What steps did we use there? Eight and Nine.
</i>

Then we resolutely turn our thoughts to someone we can help. Love and tolerance of others is our code.

<i>**Charlie**: It looks to me like if we follow the directions in the book, then we will be doing Steps 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 every day on a daily basis for the rest of our lives. I would defy anybody in this room to do 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 on daily basis and stay the way you are. You absolutely cannot do that. I've got that little inventory sheet right up there in my head, just as plain as day and you do too. And what I've trained myself to do, if I get screwed up at 9 o'clock in the morning. Used to be I wait until I went to bed at night to do something about it. Well, when I do that I've wasted another day in anger and worry and depression. I finally trained myself and when I get screwed up about 9 o'clock, get off in the corner by myself. Say okay, Charlie, who are you mad at? What did they do to you? What part of self is affected? What if anything did you do to set it in motion? Which character defect has come back to the surface? I can't get upset unless one of those old character defects has come back. Selfish (`D601`), dishonest (`D301`), self-seeking (`D606`), frightened (`D701`) or inconsiderate (`D402`). I can spot it just like that. I say okay, God, you know I don't want to be this way, please take this away from me. This selfishness or this dishonesty, or whatever it is. I try to discuss it with someone immediately, preferably my sponsor, sometimes I can, sometimes I can't, but I try to, then I make amends quickly if I hurt anybody in this process. 10, 15, 20 minutes, it's all gone. The rest of the day is okay. I have wasted all of the time that I want to waste in resentments (`D203`) and fear (`D701`) and anger (`D202`) and worry (`D708`) and depression (`D709`) and etc. I don't have to do that anymore, my God I love to feel good. I just don't want to waste any more time, what little I've got left. and that other kind of Jazz I've got a tool here that works every time. As you continue to take personal inventory, as you continue to look and see who you're mad at and etc. You're going to learn more about yourself. As you ask God to take these things away they become less and less. As you discuss them with another human being and preferably our sponsor we know more about ourselves. As we make amends quickly our relationship with the world and everybody in it becomes better and better. You can't do Step Ten the way the book says and stay the way you are, you just can't. Your relationship with God with yourself and with your fellow man will become better and better. A new dimension of living that we never dreamed existed. Now, be careful this is just like Six and Seven. This is the other changing step, and if you stay fouled up you can't blame it on anybody else any longer because if you're fouled up and you use Step Ten you can get rid of that stuff. But if you stay fouled up and stay angry and worried and depressed and selfish and dishonests, it's got to be because that's the way you want to be. I can't blame it on anybody or God or anything else any longer. Once in a great while I like to be screwed up. There's times I like to be mad, because when I'm mad I can romp and stomp and raise hell with everybody around me all day long and that gives me a comfortable feeling of superiority and once in a while I just love it. There's times I like to be afraid. Because I can use that to rationalize and justify not doing what I should do or just as importantly doing something I shouldn't do but when I do that anymore I don't enjoy it like I used to. Somewhere about the middle of it I catch myself, when I say, Okay Idiot. You're doing it to yourself again. This thing really does work and you'll continue to grow. Now ever Step Ten, you've got another set of promises. Let's look at them for just a moment.
</i>

<i>**Joe**: It says
</i>

**Bill (read by Joe)**: And we have ceased fighting anything or anyone–even alcohol. For by this time sanity will have returned. 

<i>**Joe**: Remember it said we came to believe that a Power greater than ourself would restore us to sanity. Well we get our sanity back on page 84 by the way.
</i>

<p class="text-muted">
**Bill (read by Joe)**: For by this time sanity will have returned. 
</p>

**Bill (read by Joe)**: <span class="bg-promise">We will seldom be interested in liquor. If tempted, we recoil from it as from a hot flame. We react sanely and normally, and we will find that this has happened automatically. We will see that our new attitude toward liquor has been given us without any thought or effort on our part. It just comes! That is the miracle of it. We are not fighting it, neither are we avoiding temptation. We feel as though we had been placed in a position of neutrality–safe and protected. We have not even sworn off. Instead, the problem has been removed. It does not exist for us. We are neither cocky nor are we afraid. That is our experience. That is how we react so long as we keep in fit spiritual condition.</span>

<i>**Joe**: And remember way back on page 45 it said that the main object of this book is to enable me to find a Power greater than myself which would solve my problem and somewhere between there and here we have the first 10 steps of the program of Alcoholics Anonymous. One day into 6, 7, 8 months of sobriety I'm working these steps I looked up one day and I said what happened to that desire of drink that I used to have? It's just gone, I mean it is just gone. Seemingly without any effort on my part. I found the power and the power solved the problem. It was just gone. That's the miracle of it.

### Step 11

<i>**Charlie**: Now, the next to the last paragraph on page 85
</i>

**Bill (read by Charlie)**: Much has already been said about receiving strength, inspiration, and direction 

<i>**Charlie**: not suggestion
</i>

**Bill (read by Charlie)**: from Him who has all knowledge and power. If we have carefully followed directions, 

<i>**Charlie**: not suggestions
</i>

**Bill (read by Charlie)**: we have begun to sense the flow of His Spirit into us. To some extent we have become God-conscious. We have begun to develop this vital sixth sense. But we must go further and that means more action.

<i>**Charlie**: In other words, what's happened to us in these steps of 3 through 10 we've removed enough self-will that we're now becoming God conscious. And by now we're beginning to recieve some directions from God. Now if the book says that God has all power in all direction and I believe he does the book says so and it says God dwells within each of us and I believe he does the book says so. Then it really stands to reason that you and I have within ourselves all the knowledge and all the power that we could ever need to handle any situation which comes up in the future. It's called a sixth sense of direction. I've got five senses. Everything I know on a conscious level I learned from those. I can see and I can hear and I can smell like and taste and I can touch. But what little bit I've learned through my five senses. The direction is just a small amount of knowledge but if God has all knowledge and all power if I can tap into him, then I can handle any situation in the future with God's help. Whatever it might be. It's long been known when we do that you develop the sixth sense of direction through prayer and meditation. When we get here we--I didn't know anything about meditation. I thought meditation is when you tried to clear your mind of all thought. Well, I've never been able to do that when I wake up in the morning, that sucker turns on and it will not clear out. I thought maybe it was chanting listening to soft music. That's probably some forms of meditation but I knew nothing about any of it. I knew very little about prayer I was raised in church, I only knew 2 prayers, one went like this:
</i>

<blockquote>
"Now lay me down to sleep, I pray the Lord my soul to keep;
If I die before I wake, I pray the Lord my soul to take."
</blockquote>

<i>**Charlie**: I'm not into that prayer anymore where that's dealing with death and I don't want nothing to do with that. The other prayer that I used and I bet you used it too. It went like this
</i>

<blockquote>
"God, if you get me out of this damn mess, 
I swear I'll never do this again"
</blockquote>

<i>**Charlie**: Now, I'm going to have to develop the life of prayer and meditation, which seemed to be impossible wouldn't it. Bill W. is faced with the job of teaching people who are spiritually bankrupt how to pray and meditate and Bill W. doesn't know how to do it either. Thank God he didn't, because if he had really been knowledgeable he would have written it in such a manner that I could never have understood it. But he didn't know enough about it to be able to do that. What he did do is what he's done all the way through the book. He gives us some definite valuable suggestions. And he said if we will use those in our lives today. We will develop our own life of prayer and meditation. He couldn't tell us how to pray and meditate, but he could tell us how to develop our own. He starts for just a few moments over on page 86. He tells us what to do when we go to bed at night here it is now in Step Eleven.
</i>

<p class="text-muted">STEP ELEVEN suggests prayer and meditation. We shouldn’t be shy on this matter of prayer. Better men than we are using it constantly. It works, if we have the proper attitude and work at it. It would be easy to be vague about this matter. Yet, we believe we can make some definite and valuable suggestions.</p>

**Bill (read by Joe)**: When we retire at night, we constructively review our day. Were we resentful (`D203`), selfish (`D601`), dishonest (`D301`) or afraid (`D701`)? 

<i>**Charlie**: I believe that's Step Four again isn't it?
</i>

Do we owe an apology?

<i>**Charlie**: That must be Steps Eight and Nine again.
</i>

Have we kept something to ourselves which should be discussed with another person at once? 

<i>**Charlie**: And I believe that's Step Five again.
</i>

Were we kind and loving toward all? What could we have done better? Were we thinking of ourselves most of the time? Or were we thinking of what we could do for others, of what we could pack into the stream of life? But we must be careful not to drift into worry (`D708`), remorse (`D608`) or morbid reflection (`D607`), for that would diminish our usefulness to others. After making our review we ask God’s forgiveness and inquire what corrective measures should be taken.

<i>**Charlie**: There's Step Six and Seven again. So what the book is really suggesting is when we go to bed at night we sit down and kind of take another little inventory. Step Ten was during the day when we're disturbed. Step Eleven is before we go to bed at night. We made up a little sheet here you could use. You can use anything you want to. The main thing is do we inventory or not. One side of the sheet we took the basic character defects: selfish, self-seeking, dishonest, frightened, inconsideration. We took all the other defects in the 12 and 12 which are the offshoots of those first four. Put them on the left-hand side of the sheet and called them the personality characteristics of a self-will person. We tried to find the opposite and put them on the right-hand side of the sheet. Call that the personality characteristics of a God-will person. Now all we're trying to do is get from the left-hand side of the sheet to the right-hand side. And I can sit down at night with this little sheet and run down through it making a few check marks that shows me where I've been that day shows me what I need to continue to work on. Never do I find myself on either side of the sheet, the check marks change locations from time to time. But I'm beginning to notice that I'm marking more of them on the right than I am on the left. And slowly over a period of time we cnotinue to become a different human being. Now I've learned one thing about my sobriety. I am going to inventory. I've got one or two choices: I can put it off and put it off until I'm so sick that I'm almost drunk. And then I start trying to dig myself out from under that mess. Or I can take just a few minutes each day and by doing it a few minutes each day I'll keep myself in reasonably good condition and I'm in much less chance of drinking. I find that it takes less energy to do it on a daily basis then it does to wait until I'm almost drunk and then trying to dig myself out from under it. A very definite valuable suggestion. The next paragraph tells us what to do in the morning when we get up
</i>

**Bill (read by Charlie)**: On awakening let us think about the twenty-four hours ahead. We consider our plans for the day. Before we begin, we ask God to direct our thinking, especially asking that it be divorced from self-pity (`D601`), dishonest (`D301`) or self-seeking (`D606`) motives. Under these conditions we can employ our mental faculties with assurance, for after all God gave us brains to use. Our thought-life will be placed on a much higher plane when our thinking is cleared of wrong motives.

<i>**Charlie**: Most of us get up in the morning, first thing we do is go to the bathroom. One guy told me the first thing he did was get on a treadmill. I said man you got a better bladder than I've got I go to the bathroom first. Then we head for the kitchen, and we get a cup of coffee and maybe a little food and we feed the body. We get the body taken care of we go back to the bathroom again and you ladies fix your hair and we men fix our beards or faces or whatever and we get that part of us done we go to the closet and we begin to pick out the clothes that are going to cover the body throughout the day.
</i>

<i>**Joe**: Make sure they match now.
</i>

<i>**Charlie**: Gotta make sure they match, the right color we spend lots of time on our clothes. After we get the body all taken care of, we feed the cat or the dog, we start out the door, we lock the door behind us we don't want anybody to steal our junk, we go out to the car and we check the air in the tires and we check the fuel in the fuel tank we turn the switch on start the motor and we take off down the road. But what did we do about our minds that morning we took care of all the material including our body what did we do our minds. Our minds are going to run the whole show all day. Did we check the air there? Did we check the fuel level there? Did we feed the mind a little bit? If we would take 5 to 10 minutes in the morning to ask God to direct our thinking throughout the day. Ask God to give us the right thought and action before we even start thinking about the day then chances are our thoughts about the day are going to be in better shape. If we spent 5 minutes in the morning there coupled with 5 minutes in the evening when we go to bed there's no telling what we could do with our minds. If we spent as much time on our minds as we do on our bodies, my God we can become anything couldn't we. If you spent 5 in the morning and 5 in the evening you've still got 23 hours and 50 minutes to screw the thing up. It only takes a little bit of time. Very definite valuable suggestion.
</i>

**Bill (read by Charlie)**: In thinking about our day we may face indecision. We may not be able to determine which course to take. Here we ask God for inspiration, an intuitive thought or a decision. We relax and take it easy. We don’t struggle. 

<span class="text-muted">We are often surprised how the right answers come after we have tried this for a while.</span>

<p class="text-muted">
What used to be the hunch or the occasional inspiration gradually becomes a working part of the mind. Being still inexperienced and having just made conscious contact with God, it is not probable that we are going to be inspired at all times. We might pay for this presumption in all sorts of absurd actions and ideas. Nevertheless, we find that our thinking will, as time passes, be more and more on the plane of inspiration. We come to rely upon it.
</p>

<i>**Charlie**: This is a form of meditation for busy people. We alcoholics don't have time to lay down on the floor and listen to soft music we don't have time for chanting and all that stuff we're busy people. Yeah the book says when you face indecision you can't decide what to do recognize you don't have the answer turn to God and ask God for the right thought or decision don't stuggle relax and take it easy now I think what this means is get your mind off on something else and the way I get my mind off on something else is I go start mowing the grass, painting the house, or watching the dishes. And quite often my mind goes back to that subject and I've got information I didn't have before. It says why don't you call Bill maybe he'll know and I call Bill and Bill's got the answer. I used to say my wasn't it lucky that I called Bill. No. This is a form of tapping into the sixth sense of direction. And if you practice at it and practice at it--it gets to where it becomes a common thing to do. It's amazing how this stuff works very simple suggestions. Page 87 first full paragraph down there toward the middle of the page tells us how to pray.
</i>

<i>**Joe**: It says 
</i>

**Bill (read by Joe)**: We usually conclude the period of meditation with a prayer that we be shown all through the day what our next step is to be, that we be given whatever we need to take care of such problems. We ask especially for freedom from self-will, and are careful to make no request for ourselves only. We may ask for ourselves, however, if others will be helped. We are careful never to pray for our own selfish ends. Many of us have wasted a lot of time doing that and it doesn't work. You can easily see why.

<i>**Joe**: As I said I used to use God like an errand boy sending about to get this there and get that done, it didn't he never did come back with nothing you know but I learned through doing that start praying only for the knowledge of his will for me and the power to carry that out and today I can't think of anything that would be better than to have God's will done in my life only it would be a whole lot better than anything as I could ever dream of because as I said here today I am in place today in many, many areas of my life that you can't get to other than by God's grace it cannot be done you know I was practicing this thing around and one day I was listening to the radio and I heard her song that I heard all my life and it talks about having a plane of inspiration and I heard this song all my life it's called in the garden you all know that song and it came to me well that's a song about prayer and meditation didn't in the morning what I do is still on the roses that's about prayer and meditation and I didn't know that it just came to me and I can read these things and I can see it you see these things today and I know what they mean I mean I really do know what they mean I don't know where that came from either certainly what anything for me I think it's God working in my life I believe that. 
</i>

<i>**Charlie**: They said to me pray only for knowledge of his will and the power to carry that out. I said how the hell is he gonna know what I want. Any they said he don't care what you want they said he's interested in what you need and he knows more about what you need than you know yourself and that's turned out to be exactly true If I had written a list of things that I thought I needed when I first came into A.A. I'd have said God give me these things and I will be satisfied for the rest of my life I would have cheated myself God has given me things far far far beyond my dreams could possibly be when I first came to A.A. absolutely amazing the things that take place in our life by simply trying to follow God's will. People who have been self-will like us who have literally destroyed ourselves on the self-will. We don't need to be telling God what we want. God knows what we need and if we do his will he's going to see that we get it you know who could ever a dream years and years ago we could be sitting in this room today doing what we're doing. A week ago we were in Reykjavík, Iceland the place I wanted to visit all my life. And by Golly I got to tour Iceland hell I'm 69 years old now before I got to do it, but I finally got to do it. I couldn't have done that if I'd been drinking. A year or two ago I got to go through the chunnel under the English channel I read something in a magazine when I was a kit about 9 years old it said sooner or later the English and the French would build that thing I said then if they ever build it I'm going to go through it. Finally, finally I got to go through the chunnel and ride that damn chunnel train doing 200 miles an hour. 60 years I dreamed that dream finally got to do it. Oh yeah, God knows what we need He's not interested in what we want. Page 87
</i>

**Bill (read by Joe)**: If circumstances warrant, we ask our wives or friends to join us in morning meditation. 

<p class="text-muted">If we belong to a religious denomination which requires a definite morning devotion, we attend to that also. If not members of religious bodies, we sometimes select and memorize a few set prayers which emphasize the principles we have been discussing. There are many helpful books also. Suggestions about these may be obtained from one's priest, minister, or rabbi. Be quick to see where religious people are right. Make use of what they offer.</p>

<i>**Joe**: About 15 years ago we were sitting in my living room. My wife over there in her chair and me in mine and I'm reading my prayer and meditation stuff and she's reading her prayer and meditation stuff and she looked over and said Joe would you oh wait she said "Honey" that's what she said and I said "I'm not ready for that this morning" you know you old silly thing I want you to read this for me and tell me what it says. I said "Well I can do that." So I read that for her and told her what it said and I told her a lot more than she wanted to know about it, and the next morning she said would you read this and  tell me what it says and I did and we discussed that a little bit, and that kind of set up a little deal in our house of praying together and sharing together we hadn't done that before. I've heard all my life those people that pray together stay together. Joe how long has it been since you and Phyllis have had a divorce and I didn't evevr thought about that she'd come up with that.
</i>

<i>**Charlie**: Bottom of Page 87
</i>

**Bill (read by Charlie)**: As we go through the day we pause, when agitated or doubtful, and ask for the right thought or action. We constantly remind ourselves we are no longer running the show, humbly saying to ourselves many times each day “Thy will be done.” We are then in much less danger of excitement, fear, anger, worry, self-pity, or foolish decisions. We become much more efficient. We do not tire so easily, for we are not burning up energy foolishly as we did when we were trying to arrange life to suit ourselves.

**Bill (read by Charlie)**: It works–it really does.

<i>**Charlie**: That's the full paragraph right there. 
</i>
 
**Bill (read by Charlie)**: We alcoholics are undisciplined. So we let God discipline us in the simple way we have just outlined.

<i>**Charlie**: And if you'll follow these definite and valuable suggestions on page 86 87 you will develop your own life of prayer and meditation you'll make your conscious contact you'll be able to tap into that sixth sense of direction and it's amazing the things that we can learn by doing that.
</i>

<span class="text-muted">But this is not all. There is action and more action. "Faith without works is dead." The next chapter is entirely devoted to *Step Twelve*.</span>

<!-- * END OF 11TH STEP (S11)
  -- BEGIN OF 12TH STEP (S12)
  -->
<hr/>

### Step 12

<i>**Charlie**: Okay we're going to talk now just a little bit about Step Twelve and then we'll be done. We don't want to go through this next chapter we don't have the time but I do want to look at two or three things very briefly. Let's go to page 92 now and this is telling us how to work with other people how to do our 12-step call how to sponsor and etc. The first paragraph says 
</i>

**Bill (read by Charlie)**: Tell him how baffled you were, how you finally learned that you were sick. Give him an account of the struggles you made to stop. Show him the mental twist which leads to the first drink of a spree. We suggest you do this as we have done it in the chapter on alcoholism. If he is alcoholic, he will understand you at once. 

<i>**Charlie**: See, this is what Dr. Silkworth told Bill to do
</i>

**Bill (read by Charlie)**: He will match your mental inconsistencies with some of his own.

**Bill (read by Charlie)**: If you are satisfied that he is a real alcoholic, begin to dwell on the hopeless feature of the malady. Show him, from your own experience, how the queer mental condition surrounding that first drink prevents normal functioning of the willpower. 

<i>**Charlie**: In other words, we share our story and we show him our allergy our obsession of the mind our hopeless condition of the mind and body and if he's a real alcoholic he'll match it immediately. We get his attention that way we tell him exactly what's wrong with him. Page 93
</i>

<!-- Don't, at this stage, refer to this book, unless he has seen it and wishes to discuss it. And be careful not to brand him as an alcoholic. Let him draw his own conclusion. If he sticks to the idea that he can still control his drinking, tell him that possibly he can--if he is not too alcoholic. But insist that if he is severly afflicted, there may be little chance he can recover by himself. -->

**Bill (read by Charlie)**: Let him ask you that question, if he will. Tell him exactly what happened to you. Stress the spiritual feature freely. If the man be agnostic or atheist, make it emphatic that he does not have to agree with your conception of God. He can choose any conception he likes, provided it makes sense to him. The main thin is that he be willing to believe in a Power greater than himself and that he live by spiritual principles.

<i>**Charlie**: In sharing our story and telling him what happened then we get the idea of the need for the spiritual experience accross to him after we got his attention by talking about the problem page 94
</i>

**Bill (read by Charlie)**: Outline the program of action, explaining how you made a self-appraisal, how you straightened out your past and why you are now endevoring to be helpful to him. 

<i>**Charlie**: Talk to him about the program of action taking him by the hand and walk with him through the program of action you see it's suggesting here that we do the same thing the first 100 did it's suggesting here we do the same thing the Big Book does you see the Big Book was the 12th Step in print they could not go call on that person individually so the book had to tell him the problem tell him the solution show him the program of action now it's just as valid today working with other alcoholics as it was in 1939 we need have no question about how to 12-step we need have no question about how to sponsor. This chapter tells us exactly how to do it. And I said to my sponsor one time I said I'm afraid to work with another person I'm afraid I'll hurt them. He said Charlie you can't hurt them. He said they're going to die from alcoholism anyhow that there's no way you can hurt them and you might help yourself. So if you're not working with others yet for God's sake start the 12th Step has 3 pieces in it very briefly the first part is the greatest promise in the book. Having had a spiritual awakening as the result of these steps. I think that promises to me that if I apply the first 11 steps in my life to the best of my ability I will have a spiritual awakening. Now what is a spiritual awakening? A personality change sufficient to recover from alcoholism. Bill tells us in the 12 and 12 there's many kinds of spiritual awakenings as there are in A.A. but they've all got certain theings in common that is if we're able to feel believe and do things we could never do before on our own strength unaided. I feel things I've never felt before I feel love patience tolerance compassion and goodwill toward my fellow man. Before A.A. I could have cared less abuot you oh yeah you can have some but I always got mine first I don't feel that way anymore I believe things I never believed before I believe that God is a kind and loving God I believe he stands ready to help any human being anywhere in the world the instant they're ready to give up on self-will and turn to Him. When I came here I thought he was hail, fire, brimstnoe I thought he was the God of justice. Thank God he's not a God of justice. If he was I wouldn't be here today, would I some of you guys wouldn't be here either if he was surely, surely he's pure mercy. Pure love I believe that with all of my heart. I can do things I never could do before my God I can't stay sober I never could do that before and because of the fact I'm sober I'm allowed to do many things that I never dreamed that I could ever do like being here going to Iceland riding under the chunnel going to Paris, France, things that I never could do before so surely I've had some kind of spiritual awakening Now I'm charged though with the responsibility there really are no free rides you do have to pay for what you recieve I'm now charged with the responsibility of carrying this message to other alcoholics not a message not the message not some message, this message. What is this message? Having a spiritual awakening as the result of these steps I'm not like I used to be Now if you're in A.A. today and yuo're all screwed up and you don't feel good if you've been doing a little drinking or even thinking about doing a little drinking I know exactly where you're coming from that's where I came from too but I applied these first 11 steps and I had a spiritual awakening I'm not that way anymore and if you don't want to be that way anymore then you apply the first eleven steps and you won't be that way anymore either. Because you'll have a spiritual awakening that's the only message that A.A. has got. Some of us start fancying ourselves as healers. Marrital advisors, spiritual advisors, economic advisors, I don't know of anybody that screwed those things up worse than we have. No. We just know one thing let me tell you smoething the one thing we know we know it better than anybody alive. you and I know more about alcoholism than anybody alive we're the only people that's ever experienced it we know more about recovery from alcoholism than anybody alive we're the only people that's ever done it. I think we're the luckyest people in the world I think surely, surely, surely God got tired of seeing people like us die back in the 1930s I think he decided to do something about it and he's always worked with people through people now maybe he picked Bill and Bob and the first 100 I he picked Ebby Thatcher and Dr. Jung and Dr. Silkworth and the Oxford Groupers and that whole bunch and put them together so we could have it today and if that's true and he picked people then and we've got to realize that all those people are dead and gone they're no longer here if he picked them then and surely he's still picking them today there's not an alcoholic in this room that ought to be here every one of us ought to be dead some of us two or three times and we said my wasn't we lucky last night I don't think luck had anything to do with it I think God picked you out let you suffer your alcoholism so you would learn what He wanted you to know and then when He got ready to use you He removed the obsession to drink that's the only reason we're here today. To be able to help other alcoholics. They tell me that 97 out of 100 of us are going to die never even knowing we're alcoholic if that's true, then 3% of us are stumbling in the doors of A.A. less than half of us are recovering we're talking about 1 out of 100. They use to say God why am I an alcoholic? Today I say God why am I not one of those dying from alcoholism he's got a job for me he's got a job for you and it's only when you fit into God's plan for you that you really become happy I think every human being on earth today God's got a certain purpose for them and I think ours is to carry this msesage of recovery to other alcoholics we have the ability to avery death in countless thousands and thousands of people very few people have that opportunity carrying this message is very simple just do it like the book says to do it and it always works for those that want it if they don't want it we can't do anything about that the final thing I have to do is practice these principles in all my affairs now what are the principles oh we hear arguments about these all the time the principle of one is this and the principle two is that. No, no. I think he's referring to the steps. He said having had a spiritual awakening as the result of these steps. He already used steps once in step 12 so he's not going to use it twice. So this time he'll call them principles, in another place he calls them proposals in the front of the 12 and 12 he says the 12 steps of Alcoholics Anonymous are a set of principles he's referring to the steps now it's easy for me to practice the 12 steps of Alcoholics Anonymous in A.A. I love you I hope you love me and we're going to do our best not to hurt each other but I'm only in A.A. at the most an average of an hour a day what do I do the other 23 hours can I practice these principles these steps in my home with my spouse can I realize just how powerless I really am over that lady can I realize the insanity of trying to control her knowing full well that I can't can I make a decision to turn her will and her life over to the care of God as I understand Him can I inventory me and find those defects of character that keep me trying to control can I talk about that to another human being can I become willing to have God remove and ask him to do so and take those away? Can I make amends to her quickly when I've harmed her. Now there's times I'm ashamed of me there's times I treat absolute strangers on the street with more courtesy than I treat my own wife in my own home just think if I could practice these principles there with her and she with me well we might pick up 10, 12 hours a day where we could be peaceful happy and free in our home. if we don't practice them we don't stand a chance we're at each other's throat continually can I practice them with my children if I can do this with my children what little time I have left with them is going to be good times if I don't I try to control, they resist we have no good times at all I might pick up an hour or two or three a day there. Can I do it on the job with my coworkers you know if I can do it on the job with my coworkers well I might be happy peaceful and tree there for 8 or 9 or 10 hours a day. Aren't we really saying that we have a set of tools that if we practice them in all of our affairs we can be peaceful happy and free and serene 24 hours a day 365 days a year if we wish my sponsor used to say Charlie you can be just as happy as you want to be and I'd say you old fart you have no idea what you're talking about. Today I hear myself saying you can be just as happy as you want to be you got the toold to do it with now make no mistake God is not going to do this for you other people are not going to do this for you but you with God's help and the help of other people can do it for yourself I think we're the luckiest people in the world I really do, Joe?

<i>**Joe**: Where does all that stuff come from? It comes from the best of medicine phychology and religion and there's a story in that other book about this fellow he was walking around practicing these principles and carrying this message and one night he told the people there he said the things that I can do you can do also and even greater. Well a couple of guys heard this and they went back to the little village they had a sick friend there they brought him to the meeting the next night now I like to think they were alcoholics because they went up on ther oof and they chopped a hole in it and they let the guy down in there and he looked up at that guy and he looked up at them and he says by your faith that this man was healed see it was by the faith in the fellowship of Alcoholics Anonymous when I arrived that I was able to hang around till I could come to believe that I could come to take some decisions so that I too could come to have faith the fellowship of Alcoholics Anonymous was extremely important to me it was by their faith for me. Later on he was in a little town called Cernan and after the meeting that night he was leading the meeting or speaking at the meeting and after the meeting that night they were standing around smoking cigarettes and drinking wine I guess or coffee or whatever they were doing and and they were talking and they told him about a fellow they had locked in a cave on the side of the hill now this might have been the first treatment center, I don't know and he said "I want to go up and talk to this guy" You don't want to talk to this guy, this guy is full of resentments and full of fear and he's harmed a lot of people we've got him chained to the wall up there so he won't harm himself or other people you don't want to go up and talk to him "Yeah I do, what's his name?" He said his name is legions for he is many, many defects of character so he went up there and talked to this guy for a little while turned him loose cut loose of his resentment cut loose of his fear cut free is guilt, shame, remorse and set him free now he wrote a little step for us right here because the other people that he's helped those other twelve guys he's helped he took them with him and Legion wanted to go with him he said can I go with you and do what you do and he said no Legion I want you to stay here and tell people what happened to you

<i>**Charlie**: I think they call that pass it on. Is what Bill Wilson said Barbara Barbara are you here? Where are you hun? I want y'all to meet Barbie in case you haven't got to meet her. You can tell by looking at her why I'm in love with her she's read-headed, oolly.

<i>**Joe**: Okay let's go to page 164. It says

**Bill (read by Joe)**: Our book is meant to be suggestive only. We realize we know only a little. God will constantly disclose more to you and to us. Ask Him in your morning meditation what you can do each day for the man who is still sick. The answers will come, if your own house is in order. But obviously you cannot transmit something you haven't got. See to it that your relationship with Him is right, 

<i>**Joe**: That's the only relationship this book talks about 

**Bill (read by Joe)**: and great events will come to pass for you and countless others. This is the Great Fact for us.

**Bill (read by Joe)**: Abandon yourself to God as you understand God. 

<i>**Charlie**: We did that in Steps 1, 2, and 3
</i>

**Bill (read by Joe)**: Admit your faults to Him and to your fellows. 

<i>**Charlie**: We did that in 4, 5, 6, and 7
</i>

**Bill (read by Joe)**: Clear away the wreckage of your past. 

<i>**Charlie**: We did that in 8 and 9
</i>

**Bill (read by Joe)**: Give freely of what you find and join us. 

<i>**Charlie**: We did that in 10, 11, 12
</i>

**Bill (read by Joe)**: We shall be with you in the Fellowship of the Spirit, and you will surely meet some of us as you trudge the Road of Happy Destiny.

**Bill (read by Joe and Charlie)**: May God bless you and keep you--until then.

<i>**Charlie**: We love you all. Thanks for letting us be here!
