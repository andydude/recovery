<i>
**Charlie**: We've had medical people, spiritual people, throughout our history try to determine what alcoholism is. There was a Doctor named [Dr. Trotter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Trotter_(physician)) that lived in England, a long time ago. He said
</i>

<i>
**Dr. Thomas Trotter**: I believe that alcoholism is an illness.
</i>

<i>
**Charlie**: But he couldn't explain what it was; therefore, he didn't have an answer for it. There was a doctor who lived here in the United States named [Dr. Benjamin Rush](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Rush). He was one of the signers of the Declaration of Independence. He wrote a paper on alcoholism, described the alcoholic, and he thought it was an illness too--but he couldn't name what it was. He couldn't determine it, so he had no solution. 
</i>

<i>
**Charlie**: It's only in this century that we have been able to find out what alcoholism is. And once we found out what it is, then we could find the solution to it. I don't think we alcoholics who are in A.A. realize how lucky--lucky--we really are. To be living in the period of time where we found out what alcoholism is, and we found out the solution to it. 
</i>

<i>
**Charlie**: As I look at our history--which we're going to be doing a lot of this weekend--I'm convinced in my mind that God got tired of seeing people like us die from alcoholism. And He took various different people from around the world and gave us these pieces of information that allow us to recover from that condition today. 
</i>

<i>
**Charlie**: And I think one of the first persons He used was this little doctor called [Dr. Silkworth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Duncan_Silkworth). When Dr. Silkworth was in medical school, he became very interested in we alcoholics. But when he got out of medical school, he learned--like most doctors did--that it was very difficult to make a living working with alcoholics. Most doctors do not like to work with alcoholics. They said it then, and they say it today, that 
</i>

<i>
**Most doctors**: An alcoholic will not tell you the truth. 
</i>

<i>
**Charlie**: That's certainly true, isn't it? And they said 
</i>

<i>
**Most doctors**: They will not do what we tell them to do. 
</i>

<i>
**Charlie**: And that's certainly true, isn't it? They said 
</i>

<i>
**Most doctors**: The main reason we don't want to work with them is that they won't pay their bills. 
</i>

<i>
**Charlie**: So Dr. Silkworth in order to find a way to make a living decided to go off into another field, but always interested in we alcoholics. And he became very successful in his field. But in the late 1920s we had of course the great stock market crash, and Silky had almost everything he owned in the stock market, and he lost it just like everybody else did. Lost the good job he had, and he had to find a job smoewhere. [Charlie Towns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_B._Towns) from the Towns Hospital, who Silky had met before, through his interest in alcoholics, offered him a job. He said 
</i>

<i>
**Charles B. Towns (paraphrased by Charlie)**: Why don't you come work here, and I'll pay you $30 a week, and room and board, and you can help me working with alcoholics.
</i>

<i>
**Charlie**: So Silky went to work in the Town Hospital in 1930. And he began to work with people like us, and he began to see us come into the hospital, terrible terrible physical mental condition. And he began to withdrawl us from alcohol, build the body up, etc. and 30, 60, 90 days later, and he would see us leave the hospital in reasonably good shape. And a month or 2 or 3 or 4 later, he would see us come back in in worse shape than we were before. Continually going in and out, in and out, in and out. He also noticed some people who he worked with that drank like we drank, but did not go in and out, in and out, in and out. He also noticed other people who drank moderately and safely. And he began to say
</i>

<i>
**Dr Silkworth (paraphrased by Charlie)**: There's something different about these alcoholics. There's something different about the body. Apparently, alcohol does something to them, that it doesn't do to normal people. 
</i>

<i>
**Charlie**: And he began to develop this little idea that when you put alcohol in your body it produces an actual physical craving that makes it impossible for us to stop drinking. But he also said that even in those days that it's not the real problem of the alcoholic. He said 
</i>

<i>
**Dr Silkworth (paraphrased by Charlie)**: The real problem is that the alcoholic cannot keep from drinking. People who are heavy drinkers, people who are moderate drinkers, if they want to quit drinking, they just quit, and it don't bother them at all. But it seems as though the alcoholic after they quit, the mind begins to play tricks on them, and begins to think about 1 or 2 drinks, and how it makes them feel. That idea becomes so powerful that it overcomes the idea that they can't drink, and they take a drink, and they end up drunk every time. Now if you can't drink safely, and if you can't keep from drinking, then you are powerless over alcohol.
</i>

<i>
**Charlie**: Now we don't know if Bill Wilson is the first one he told that to or not. But we do know that Bill is probably the first one to act on that information. Then after Bill got sober, and after Dr Bob got sober, and after Bill Dotson got sober, and after the first 40 got sober, based on that information, and decided to write the book, they went to see Dr. Silkworth, and said 
</i>

<i>
**First alcoholics**: Will you let us put that information in the book, so that other alcoholics can see what their problem is too?
</i>

<i>
**Charlie**: And they said 
</i>

<i>
**First alcoholics**: Will you write some of this for us?
</i>

<i>
**Charlie**: And the Dr. said
</i>

<i>
**Dr Silkworth**: Yeah, you can use it, and I'll write some of it under one condition: that we will call it the *Doctor's Opinion*. I can't prove it. There's no facts behind it. So we'll just have to call it an opinion. By the way don't use my name. They'll throw me completely out of the medical profession if you use my name on this deal.
</i>

<i>
**Charlie**: In 1956, when they came out with the second edition, by that time the [American Psychiatric Association](https://www.psychiatry.org/) had recognized the fact that alcoholism is an illness, and Dr. Silkworth said in the second edition
</i>

<i>
**Dr Silkworth**: You can put my name in it now.
</i>

<i>
**Charlie**: So for the second and third, you've got Silkworth, but in here you don't. Let's look at what the doctor had to say for just a little bit.
</i>

<span class="bg-promise">We of Alcoholics Anonymous believe that the reader will be interested in the medical estimate of the plan of recovery described in this book. Convincing testimony must surely come from medical men who have had experience with the sufferings of our members and have witnessed our return to health.</span> A well-known doctor, chief physician at a nationally prominent hostpital specializing in alcoholic and drug addiction, gave Alcoholics Anonymous this letter:
</p>

<blockquote class="text-muted">
To Whom It May Concern:

I have specialized in the treatment of alcoholism for many years.

In late 1934[^late] I attended a patient[^patient] who, though he had been a competent businessman of good earning capacity, was an alcoholic of a type I had come to regard as hopeless.

[^late]: **Andrew**: The date was 1934-12-11.
[^patient]: **Andrew**: The patient was Bill W.

<span>In the course of his third treatment he acquired certain ideas concerning a possible means of recovery.</span> <span class="bg-direction">As part of his rehabilitation he commenced to present his conceptions to other alcoholics, impressing upon them that they must do likewise with still others.</span>[^likewise] <span class="bg-promise">This has become the basis of a rapidly growing fellowship of these men and their families.

[^likewise]: **Andrew**: This is step 12.

<span class="bg-warning">I personally know scores of cases who were of the type with whom other methods had failed completely.</span>

These facts appear to be of extreme medical importance; because of the extraordinary possibilities of rapid growth inherent in this group they may mark a new epoch in the annals of alcoholism. <span class="bg-promise">These men may well have a remedy for thousands of such situations.</span>

You may rely absolutely on anything they say about themselves.

### Dualism (AR)

<i>
**Joe**: Let's go to page roman numeral 24, that's xxiv, and I didn't know that when I got sober. 
</i>

**Bill (read by Joe)**: The physician[^physician] who, at our request, gave us this letter, has been kind enough to enlarge upon his views in another statement which follows. In this statement he confirms what we who have suffered alcoholic torture must believe--<u class="bg-warning">that the body of the alcoholic is quite as abnormal as his mind.</u> 

[^physician]: **Andrew**: This is a reference to Dr. Silkworth.

<i>
**Joe**: Now we know that there's no must in the fellowship of Alcoholics Anonymous, but there are a lot of musts in this book called Alcoholics Anonymous, and there's one of the first ones. We must believe that the body of the alcoholic is quite as abnormal as his mind.
</i>

<i>
**Charlie**: Now this is the first time we could find anywhere in written history, a reference to the fact that the body is affected as well as the mind. Everything up until this time, they had talked about the mind only. Weak will, moral character, sin, and etc. But here we see that the body is quite as abnormal as the mind. I think he's telling us two things that the body is affected also, but I think he's also saying the mind is abnormal when it comes to alcohol. We react to it different physically and also mentally in an abnormal manner. And we'll talk about both of those. The first one we're going to look at is the body.
</i>

**Bill (read by Joe)**: It did not satisfy us to be told that we could not control our drinking just because we were maladjusted to life, that we were in full flight from reality, or were outright mental defectives. These things were true to some extent, in fact, to a considerable extent with some of us. <span class="bg-warning">But we are sure that our bodies were sickened as well. In our belief, any picture of the alcoholic which leaves out this physical factor is incomplete.</span>

**Bill (read by Joe)**: The doctor's theory that we have an allergy to alcohol interests us. As laymen, our opinion as to its soundness may, of course, mean little. But as ex-problem drinkers, we can say that his explanation makes good sense. <u class="bg-promise">It explains many things for which we cannot otherwise account.</u>

<i>
**Charlie**: Now, the purpose of a textbook is to transfer information from the mind of one human being, through the written word, to the mind of another human being. Then it stands to reason that the transference of that information is going to be based upon the understanding of the understanding of the words that are used. If the writer of the book uses a certain word and understands it this way. The reader of the book reads that word and understands it this way--a different understanding--then the information thta comes through is going to be garbled and incomplete information. 

**Charlie**: And there seem to be a few key words in the Big Book that many of us have difficulty with. And I think the first word we had a real problem with was this word "allergy." 

**Charlie**: Most of us, when we come here, when we come here, we assume assume already that we know what an allergy is. I know I did. I knew that if you were allergic to something and you got around it, or you ate it, or you drank it--or something like that--there would be some physical manifestation or indicator of that allaergy. For instance, if you eat strawberries and you're allergic to them, you'll break out in a rash--the rash being the manifestation of that allergy. If you're allergic to milk and you drink it, you'll have a bad case of dysentery--the dysentery being the manifestation of that allergy. If you're allergic to certain plants, such as rag weed, and you get around them, your eyes and nose itch and water, and you start sneezing. That's the manifestation of that allergy. 

**Charlie**: So I knew if you were allergic to something, there would be something there that you could see. So they came to me and they said 
</i>

<i>
**First alcoholics**: Charlie, you've got an allergy to alcohol, and you'll never be able to safely drink it.
</i>

<i>
**Charlie**: And I said, How the hell can I be allergic to alcohol? I'm drinking a quart a day! How could you possibly drink that much of something that you're allergic to? And I said Besides that, when I drink alcohol I don't break out in a rash, and I don't have a bad case of dysentery. Once in a while I might, depending on what I've been drinking, but usually I didn't. Nor did it make my eyes itch, water, or cause me to sneeze. I don't understand what you're talking about, you need to explain that to me.
</i>

<i>
**First alcoholics**: You don't need to understand. All you gotta know is that you can't drink it.
</i>

<i>
**Charlie**: Well today, I think I know why they told me that. I don't think they understood it a bit better than I did. And I went from person to person to person, trying to get somebody to explain this allergy to me, and all they would say is
</i>

<i>
**First alcoholics**: What difference does it make? Forget the damned allergy. Don't drink and you'll be alright. Keep coming to meetings.
</i>

<i>
**Charlie**: Now if you're a alcoholic like I am, with a keen intellectual alcoholic mind, and you got a question like that dangling out there in front of you, sooner or later it's going to drive you out of your mind. And one day in sheer desperation, I went to a source of information that has never failed me since that time. I went to the dictionary. And I looked up the word allergy, and I found several definitions of it. What you do with any word depending on how you use it. But I think I found the one that fit me exactly. When it said
</i>

<i>
**Dictionary**: An allergy is an abnormal reaction to any food, beverage, or substance of any kind.
</i>

<i>
**Charlie**: So I began to look back over my drinking history to see where I was abnormal. And to my amazement, I found out I don't know what's normal and what's abnormal. The only thing I knew about drinking was the way I drank, and the way those people drank who drank with me, and if they didn't drink like I did, then we didn't drink together. So to find out what's normal to see if I'm abnormal, I have to go to the normal, social, temperate, moderate drinker. Those who drink alcohol and do not get in trouble with it. And I asked them to describe to me how they feel when they take a drink, and they said
</i>

<i>
**Normal drinker**: We come home from work, tired, tense, wrought up from the day's work, we can have a couple of drinks before dinner, we begin to get a relaxing, comfortable feeling. We'll go ahead and have dinner, and we probably won't drink anymore that night.
</i>

<i>
**Charlie**: I don't feel that way when I drink alcohol. Whenever I take a drink of alcohol, it passes over my lips. My lips begin to tingle, immediately. It hits my teeth, and they kind of chatter up and down. It stikes my tounge and I can feel it begin to grow, and expand, and swell. It hits my cheeks, and they kind of flutter in and out. At the same time it's passing through my sinus cavities up into my forhead, and I begin to get a feeling up in my forehead which is absolutely indescribably wonderful. And I haven't even swallowed the damn stuff yet, I've just got it in my mouth. When I swallow that alcohol, it starts down through my esophagus, great things begin to take place. The first thing that happens is that my chest begins to grow, and expand, and it gets bigger and bigger. It hits my stomach, and it litterally explodes like a bomb. Immediately I feel it racing through my arms and they get longer and longer. It hits my hands and fingers, they begin to tingle and vibrate, same time it's racing through my arms, it's racing through my legs, they're getting longer and longer. I'm getting taller and taller, and it hits my feeling toes, and they get a hot intense, burning, exciting, get up and go somewhere, and do something feeling. I don't understand the comfortable, relaxing feeling when you have a drink. These people told me something that blew my mind for me.
</i>

<i>
**Normal drinker**: Whenever we have a couple of drinks, we begin to experience a feeling of dizziness, a feeling of being out-of-control. We don't like that feeling. Therefore, 1 or 2 drinks is all we want to drink.
</i>

<i>
**Charlie**: How many times have you and I have tried to get them to drink more, and they said
</i>

<i>
**Normal drinker**: Oh, no, no. I feel this already. Oh, no, no. This is making me dizzy, I don't want anymore.
</i>

<i>
**Charlie**: Today I realize, that's the normal reaction to alcohol. You see for most people, when they put alcohol in their system. It hits the stomach, it immediately goes into the bloodstream, immediately goes to the brain. And for a normal drinker, it acts as a downer. It's a sedative. It is supposed to give them a slightly tipsy, out-of-control feeling. Now when it goes into my stomach, and into my bloodstream, and into my brain. Instead of my getting a slightly tipsy, out-of-control feeling, alcohol for me acts an upper. It's a stimulant. And my brain gets a very exciting, in-control feeling. They have 2 drinks and they want to go to bed. I have 2 drinks, and by God, I want to go to town, immediately. I react to it differently mentally. And another thing they told me was
</i>

<i>
**Normal drinker**: When we have a couple of drinks, not only do we get a slightly tipsy, out-of-control feeling, but we begin to experience a feeling of nausea. We don't like that feeling. Therefore 1 or 2 drinks is all we want to take.
</i>

<i>
**Charlie**: How many times have you tried to get them to drink more, and they said
</i>

<i>
**Normal drinker**: Oh, no, no. This is making me sick, I don't want any more of it.
</i>

<i>
**Charlie**: That's the normal reaction to alcohol. Alcohol is a toxic substance and the destroyer of human tissue. When you put it in your body, your mind and your body is supposed to react to it with nausea and say "Puke it up and get it out of here." When I put it in my body, instead of my body experiencing a feeling of nausea, my body experiences an <span class="bg-warning">actual *physical craving*</span>, which demands more of the same. Their body said "Puke it up", mine said, "Put some more in here." 

**Charlie**: So not only do I react to it differently mentally, but I also react to it differently physically. Now, the only difference between normal and abnormal is: what do the majority of the people do? If the majority--9 out of 10--react that way, and 1 out of 10 reacts the way I do, then my reaction is considered to be abnormal. Therefore, I'm considered to be allergic to alcohol. You can't see it; you can only feel it. And only alcoholics feel it. 

**Charlie**: You see I kept looking for the rash. I kept looking for the dysentery. No, you don't see our allergy, you feel it. And only we alcoholics, feel it. Joe?
</i>

<i>
**Joe**: You get in trouble going to town. That's the trouble with trouble, it always starts out with fun, doesn't it? How many of you went out to get drunk and get into trouble? I went out to get drunk and have a little fun. And that's the trouble with trouble, it always starts out with fun. At least that's the way it did with me.
</i>

<i>
**Charlie**: You know, I just love to watch normal, social, temperate, moderate drinkers. Fascinating to watch them. I saw one on the airplane yesterday. He ordered a drink, got him a mixer with it, and he put his mixer in his glass with ice in it. Poured his little bottle in there. They buy a little bitty bottle on airplanes. I think it costs them $4 today, hell there's not a drink in that bottle, period. But any-how, that's what they had, and he poured it in there, and then he took a little stick, and he went through a stirring ceremony. I don't know much about stirring when it comes to drinking, but he stirred, and he stirred, and he stirred. And after awhile he laid his little stick down. You know what he did then? He picked up his magazine, and started reading his damn magazine. I'm sitting there watching him saying "Drink the damn stuff, what the hell did you get it for?"
</i>

<i>
**Joe**: That's what we call alcohol abuse.
</i>

<i>
**Charlie**: Now that may be normal, but I call that sick to drink like that.
</i>

<i>
**Joe**: So I think I'll read this again.
</i>

<div class="text-muted">
**Bill (read by Joe)**: The doctor's theory that we have an allergy to alcohol interests us. As laymen, our opinion as to its soundness may, of course, mean little. But as ex-problem drinkers, we can say that his explanation makes good sense. <span class="bg-promise">It explains many things for which we cannot otherwise account.</span>

**Joe**: It explained to me why I would go down to the bar, with every intention of having 2, the next thing I know is it's midnight or 1 or 2 or 3 o'clock in the morning, or the next day, or the next week, and I wonder, "Well what in the hell happened? I just went down there to drink 2." Well this idea that we have an allergy to alcohol interested me.

### Hospitalization (AR)

<p class="text-muted">
Though we work out our solution on the spiritual as well as an altruistic plane, <span class="bg-direction">we favor hospitalization for the alcoholic who is very jittery or befogged. More often than not, it is imperative that a man's brain be cleared before he is approached, as he has then a better chance of understanding and accepting what we have to offer.</span>
</p>

<blockquote class="text-muted">
The doctor writes:

The subject presented in this book seems to me to be of paramount importance to those afflicted with alcoholic addiction.

I say this after many years’ experience as Medical Director of one of the oldest hospitals in the country treating alcoholic and drug addiction.

There was, therefore, a sense of real satisfaction when I was asked to contribute a few words on a subject which is covered in such masterly detail in these pages.

<span class="bg-warning">We doctors have realized for a long time that some form of moral psychology was of urgent importance to alcoholics, but its application presented difficulties beyond our conception. What with our ultra-modern standards, our scientific approach to everything, we are perhaps not well equipped to apply the powers of good that lie outside our synthetic knowledge.</span>

Many years ago one[^patient] of the leading contributors to this book came under our care in this hospital and while here <span class="bg-direction">he acquired some ideas which he put into practical application at once.</span>

Later, he requested the privilege of being allowed to tell his story to other patients here and with some misgiving, we consented. <span class="bg-promise">The cases we have followed through have been most interesting; in fact, many of them are amazing. The unselfishness of these men as we have come to know them, the entire absence of profit motive, and their community spirit, is indeed inspiring to one who has labored long and wearily in this alcoholic field. They believe in themselves, and still more in the Power which pulls chronic alcoholics back from the gates of death.</span>

<span class="bg-direction">Of course an alcoholic ought to be freed from his physical craving for liquor, and this often requires a definite hospital procedure, before psychological measures can be of maximum benefit.</span>
</blockquote>

### The physical craving (AR)

<i>
**Joe**: Now let's go to roman numeral 26.
</i>

<i>
**Charlie**: A good text book will never tell you anything that it doesn't give you more information to back it up. He's talked here about the allergy, now let's go over to roman numeral 26 first paragraph
</i>

<blockquote>
**Dr. Silkworth (read by Joe)**: <span class="bg-warning">We believe, and so suggested a few years ago, that the action of alcohol on these chronic alcoholics is a manifestation of an allergy;</span>
</blockquote>


<i>
**Joe**: I used to hate that word "chronic alcoholics." I hated it. I don't particularly like it today. But I found out that cronic just means something that you do over, and over, and over. So therefore I was a chronic drinker, or a chronic alcoholic. And it's a manifestation of allergy.
</i>


<blockquote>
**Dr. Silkworth (read by Joe)**: <span class="bg-warning">that the phenomenon of craving is limited to this class and never occurs in the average temperate drinker. These allergic types can never safely use alcohol in any form at all; and once having formed the habit and found they cannot break it, once having lost their self-confidence, their reliance upon things human, their problems pile up on them and become astonishingly difficult to solve.</span>
</blockquote>

<i>
**Joe**: This manifestation of an allergy that Charlie talked about. The <span class="bg-warning">phenomenon of craving</span>, after we take a few drinks we don't have the craving before we take a few drinks. It's only after we take a few drinks that the <span class="bg-warning">phenomenon of craving</span> develops, and then we have to have more and more and more. And only alcoholics have that. Non-alcoholics do not crave alcohol after they take a drink. They just don't. They get everything they want to drink every time they take a drink. Which is 2 or 3 maybe, and that's all they want. Because they don't have this <span class="bg-warning">phenomenon of craving</span> that alcoholics have.
</i>

<i>
**Charlie**: The action of strawberries on one who is allergic to strawberries is manifested by a rash. The action of milk on one who is allergic to milk is manifested by dysentery. The action of ragweeds on one who is allergic to ragweeds is itchy, watery eyes, sneezing, etc. The action of alcohol on one who is allergic to alcohol is manifested by, and he refers to it as, the <span class="bg-warning">phenomenon of craving</span>. He uses the word phenomenon, because he didn't understand it. So what it is, is manifested by an actual, physical craving in the body, that demands more of the same, after we once started. And the word craving is very, very important. You know I've heard people say
</i>

<i>
**Random people**: Well I came to A.A. and I craved a drink for 4 years.
</i>

<i>
**Charlie**: No, in the context of the Big Book that's the wrong use of the word craving. They might have needed a drink, and wanted a drink, and desired a drink. The only way an alcoholic can crave alcohol is to first put it in the body, then the physical craving develops, and then we can't stop and we end up drunk. So in the recovery section of the book, when you see the word craving, it's always referring to the body. Never to the mind. We'll use the word <span class="bg-warning">**obsession** for the mind</span>. The word <span class="bg-warning">**craving** is for the body</span>.
</i>

<i>
***[Skip](#classification-of-alcoholics-ar)***
</i>

<blockquote class="text-muted">
Frothy emotional appeal seldom suffices. <span class="bg-direction">The message which can interest and hold these alcoholic people must have depth and weight. In nearly all cases, their ideals must be grounded in a power greater than themselves, if they are to re-create their lives.</span>

If any feel that as psychiatrists directing a hospital for alcoholics we appear somewhat sentimental, <span class="bg-direction">let them stand with us a while on the firing line, see the tragedies, the despairing wives, the little children; let the solving of these problems become a part of their daily work, and even of their sleeping moments, and the most cynical will not wonder that we have accepted and encouraged this movement.</span> <span class="bg-warning">We feel, after many years of experience, that we have found nothing which has contributed more to the rehabilitation of these men than the altruistic movement now growing up among them.</span>
</blockquote>

### The mental obsession (AR)

<i>
**Joe**: It says
</i>

<blockquote>
**Dr. Silkworth (read by Joe)**: Men and women drink essentially because they like the effect produced by alcohol.
</blockquote>

<i>
**Charlie**: Now many alcoholics are highly offended when you say that. They say
</i>

<i>
**Many alcoholics**: No, that's not the reason I drink. The reason I drink is because I love the taste of alcohol.
</i>

<i>
**Charlie**: I wouldn't argue with them if they do or not. I love the taste of cold beer I always have all my life as far back as I can remember. I also love the taste of cold mountain spring water. I never did sit down and drink a case of cold mountain spring water. You see, that beer did something for me that that spring water didn't do. All my life as a kid growing up I was on the outside of the crowd looking in. Always wanted to be a part of and knew I could not be. Always knew that whatever I said whatever I did it would be the wrong thing people would laugh, and I would be emberassed. You ladies, I couldn't even get around you, if I got around you, I would get absolutely completely toungue-tied, you scared me to death. One night somebody gave me a drink of moonshine whiskey, and all those fears disappeared and I was allowed to ask a girl to dance with me for the first time in my life. I was allowed to take her home from the dance for the first time in my life. We got in the back seat of a 36 Chevrolet, and I was allowed to do some things that I've been wanting to do for a long, long time. I loved what alcohol to/for me. Not to me, but for me. Now if it gave me a slightly tipsy, out-of-control feeling, beginings of a nauseous feeling, I wouldn't love that. But you see it gives me that great exciting in-control feeling, and allows me to function in a manner I'd never been able to function before.
</i>

<blockquote class="text-muted">
**Dr. Silkworth (read by Charlie)**: Men and women drink essentially because they like the effect produced by alcohol.
</blockquote>

<i>
**Joe**: I think we can all pretty much identify with that effect in the beginning. I certainly had that same effect, drinking for the same reasons. But we know that alcoholism is a progressive illness too it gets worse over time and after awhile I began to do some of those things that Charlie talked about and I began to drink more and more and more. And I began to wake up some mornings with a little guilt shame remorse as a result of the things that I was doing while drinking. And that brought on more drinking and I had to drink to get rid of those feelings and so another effect by which I drank. And as the years and time went by then the trouble I had in my life went by in the end I drank for the sickest effect of all, which is total oblivion. There's only one thing wrong with oblivion, isn't there. You wake up. Then you gotta start doing it again. So there are many, many effects by which we drink, and it progressively gets worse.

**Joe**: It says
</i>

<blockquote>
**Dr. Silkworth (read by Joe)**: The sensation is so elusive that, while they admit it is injurious, they cannot after a time differentiate the true from the false. To them, their alcoholic life seems the only normal one.
</blockquote>

<i>
**Joe**: And I couldn't recognize the true from the false because my alcoholic life had become normal to me. Everywhere I went, alcohol was involved. Every bar that I went to, they drank like that and the way I did in that bar, then I didn't go to those bars. It's what I was doing down there at the Zebra Lounge. One time I remember I woke up one morning I had a clear thought. And I looked over at my wife Phyllis, and I said Phyllis, "Do you realize that most people don't drink like we do?" And you know what she said? She said "Bull-shit" That's just what she said. Everybody we know drinks just like we do. And I thought, well that's true. So my alcoholic life had become normal. The abnormal had become normal. And I couildn't hardly tell the true from the false in that light.
</i>

<i>
**Charlie**: Now, he begins to describe how people like us feel whenever we're sober in forced periods of sobriety.
</i>

<blockquote>
**Dr. Silkworth (read by Joe)**: They are restless, irritable and discontented, 

<i>
**Joe**: Put a few little words in there too, like we're full of guilt, shame, and remorse, and remember you know when we first got sober we were new we said if we didn't drink we were going to feel better well you're going to feel better alright. You're going to feel resentment better, you're going to feel anger better, you're going to feel a lot of things better.
</i>

<i>
**Charlie**: Running around feeling lousy as hell wanting to feel better knowing only one way to feel better. We begin to think about what one or two drinks will do for us. We don't think about what 20 drinks will do, or 30. We think about what 1 or 2 will do for us. 
</i>

**Dr. Silkworth (read by Joe)**: <span class="bg-warning">unless they can again experience the sense of ease and comfort which comes at once by taking a few drinks-drinks which they see others taking with impunity.</span>

<i>
**Joe**: And "impunity" simply means that those people are drinking and seemingly they don't have any problems.
</i>

**Dr. Silkworth (read by Joe)**: <span class="bg-warning">After they have succumbed to the desire again, as so many do,</span>

<i>
**Charlie**: After we have finally given in and taken a couple of drinks
</i>

**Dr. Silkworth (read by Joe)**: <span class="bg-warning">and the phenomenon of craving develops, they pass through the well-known stages of a spree, emerging remorseful, with a firm resolution not to drink again.</span>

<i>
**Joe**: And how many times have I done that? How many times have you done that? Come off of one of those big drunks a long extended period drunks, and you promise them, and say to yourself, and to anyone who is willing to listen, I'll never do it again. I'm through, I promise you, I'm through. And those of you who have made those promises you know that we were sinscere, and we meant that.
</i>

**Dr. Silkworth (read by Joe)**: <span class="bg-warning">This is repeated over and over, and unless this person can</span> <span class="bg-promise">experience an entire psychic change</span> <span class="bg-warning">there is very little hope of his recovery.</span>
</blockquote>

<i>
**Joe**: You see he quit talking about the body, now he's talking about the psychic change of mind. <span class="bg-promise">Later on in our book the psychic change is going to be described as a spiritual experience, a spiritual awakening, a personality change. All four words mean the same thing.</span>

**Dr. Silkworth (read by Joe)**: a psychic change there is very little hope of his recovery.
</blockquote>

<i>
**Charlie**: Let's look at this picture up here again for just a moment. Over here on this side, we can see the cause of the allergy--we can no longer safely drink alcohol. But as we said before, that's not going to bother us if we don't take the first drink. So apparently, the problem is going to be over on this side. The real problem centers in the mind telling us we can drink, rather than in the body that ensures that we can't drink. 

**Charlie**: What the doctor told us then--and they tell us today--is that there's nothing that can be done for that. So the only possible means of recovery would be a find a way to live where our mind doesn't tell us it's okay to drink. And we're dealing here with our emotions. We're dealing here with the way we think. We're dealing here with the way that we feel--whenever we're sober. 

**Charlie**: We are very, very complex human beings. Not only are we complex physically, but we also are complex mentally too. And all people experience emotions. All people experience, from time to time, anger, resentment, fear, worry, depression, excitement, elation, guilt, and remorse. These are all emotions that all human beings have. 

**Charlie**: Now somewhere back in our lifetime, as we began to experience those emotions when we grow up, we start seeking a solution to them. Like me--when I was a kid growing up, I was an emotional basket case. Couldn't hardly function in normal society. Always scared to death, always worried, always angry, always doing things that I shouldn't do because of the guilt and remorse associated with that. 

**Charlie**: Now I used to think only we alcoholics did that. But I found out today that that's normal--as kids grow up, everybody experiences these kinds of feelings. And they start looking for an answer. Many people find it in many different ways. Some people find that when they don't feel good emotionally, they can go out here and start working, and the excess work seems to make them feel better. Some people find that when they're emotionally riled up, they can eat certain foods and that seems to make them feel better. Some people find that when they're emotionally disturbed, if they can just get really involved deeper into sexuality, that makes them feel better. And some people find that there are establishments like this building, where if you're emotionally disturbed, you can do a little gambling and that makes you feel better. 

**Charlie**: Now it doesn't make any difference what you find that makes you feel better--when you find the solution to that emotional problem, your mind has a memory bank. It immediately records the solution. And the reason it does that is so the next time you have that emotional problem, you don't have to go looking for a solution. Your mind feeds it back to you: "Well, a little gambling made me feel better," or "That food made me feel better," or "That work made me feel better," or whatever. Now that's called mental addiction. And everybody has that.

**Charlie**: Now, we become addicted to certain types of automobiles. We become mentally addicted to our hairdressers. We become mentally addicted to certain dishwasher products that we use--dish soap. You know, we've got a problem, we find the answer, the mind records it, and feeds it back to us the next time we have the problem. 

**Charlie**: As a kid growing up, I had that emotional problem. And one night, someone gave me a drink of moonshine whiskey. And immediately, those problems disappeared. And that great, exciting, in-control feeling came over me. And I was allowed to ask that girl to dance, take her home, and get in the back seat of that 36 Chevrolet. It answered my problem that night. My mind immediately recorded what it did for me. 

**Charlie**: The next time I got into a situation where I didn't feel right, things were not right, my mind said, "If you can find a drink, you'd feel better." And I found a drink of whiskey--and God, the magic happened a second time. In other words, alcohol became the solution to my emotional problems. 

**Charlie**: Now if I had been non-alcoholic, then that worked for me. That would have been great. But I also had that physical allergy over there on that side. And when I had the problem and I used the solution, it sure enough made me feel better, but it also triggered the allergy. And I would drink more than I intended to drink, and I would end up drunk. And I would repeat that cycle over and over and over again. The mind causing me to drink, the allergy causing me to get drunk. The emotions coming off the drunk to feed the mind causing me to drink, and the drink then would trigger the allergy. And as time went by, it got worse and worse and worse. 

**Charlie**: Because this is a progressive illness. The drinking would become harder and harder. The trouble would become more and more. The restlessness, irritability, guilt, remorse--became more and more. The emotions became worse and worse. To trigger the idea of taking the first drink. The mind is destroying the body, and the body is destroying the mind. 

**Charlie**: Now somewhere down the line I said to myself, "Charlie, you're going to have to do something about your drinking." Now I didn't say "You're going to quit drinking." I said, "You're going to have to do something about your drinking." So the first thing we alcoholics do to do something about our drinking--we decide we're going to control our drinking while drinking. 

**Charlie**: Tonight we're just going to have two beers. We're just going to have two drinks. Go to the liquor store and buy half a pint--because nobody can get drunk on half a pint. And I spent 4 or 5 or 6 years trying to control my drinking while drinking. Anybody in here try to control your drinking while drinking? Well now I see why that would not work--because of the allergy. 

**Charlie**: And after 4 or 5 or 6 years trying to control my drinking while drinking, I said to myself one day "Charlie, I don't believe you can drink anymore." Took me a long time to realize it. I said, "I don't believe you can drink anymore." So what do we alcoholics do when we finally decide that we can't drink anymore? We trot out the most useful tool we have. We put it right there, and it's called willpower. And we say "sick them will. We're through with that drinking, we'll never take another drink as long as we live."

**Charlie**: Now believe me, you people that are non-alcoholic, when we say "We're going to quit drinking," that is exactly what we intend to do. You see, we are strong-willed people. We can use our willpower to handle all other problems, and we assume that we can use willpower here--and we really intend to quit drinking. 

**Charlie**: Now, as the days went by--I haven't done anything about my emotions, by the way--I'll just quit drinking. And as the days go by, these emotions begin to build up: the fear, the guilt, the remorse, the shame, the worry, the depression--they become worse and worse. It's not the big things in life that kill us. It's all the things that people have to go through on a daily basis in life. It's getting up every damn morning and going to work. It's a bitching wife. It's a griping husband. It's screaming kids. It's burnt bacon. It's broken shoe-strings. It's flat tires. All the things that everybody has to go through--and these emotions start building up. 

**Charlie**: Now after a while, the mind says, "A drink would make you feel better." But remember, I put willpower in here. And willpower says "No, siree, we're not going to drink. We've quit." And that day we don't drink. 

**Charlie**: The next day, the emotions are still here, and they're building up a little higher, and a little higher, and it says, "God, a drink would make me feel good." And the mind said "No, siree, we've quit drinking. We aren't ever going to drink again." 

**Charlie**: The next day, the emotions are still here and they're building up a little higher, and a little higher, and the mind begins to say, "Well hell, you've been sober 90 days. You've proven you're not an alcoholic. One drink wouldn't hurt anybody." And the mind says "No, we're not going to do that. We've quit drinking. Hell, we've sworn off--we'll never take another drink." 

**Charlie**: The next day, the emotions are here and they're building up higher and higher. And the mind says, "By golly, anybody who has been sober for 92 days owes themself a drink." And we begin to think about that great, exciting in-control feeling that comes with one or two drinks. We begin to think about the sense of ease and comfort that Dr. Silkworth talks about here. And as we begin to think about what alcohol is going to do **for** us, it begins to push out the idea of what it does **to** us. And we begin to forget about the jailhouse. We forget the last car wreck. We forget the divorce courts and the hospitalization. And the mind begins to key in on one thing and one thing only: what it's going to do for us. 

**Charlie**: Then, when the desire to drink comes, the willpower is no longer there. You see, the only time willpower is there is when the mind can see something wrong with what it wants to do. And just before we drink, we don't see anything wrong with drinking. Willpower becomes nonexistant. We take the drink, we trigger the allergy, we go through the well-known stages of the spree, we emerge remorseful, with a firm resolution not to do this again. 

**Charlie**: And we repeat that cycle over and over and over. The mind--body destroying the body. The mind over here, causing us to drink more and more. And if you can't safely drink because of the body, and if you can't quit because of the mind, then you've become absolutely powerless over alcohol. And that's our problem.

**Charlie**: Now if you're going to solve a problem, then you're going to have to attack it somewhere. I can't attack it over here. Can't do nothing about that. Maybe I can attack it over here. If I can find a way to live, where I can be sober and not be restless, irritable and discontented. If I can find a way to live where I can be sober and not be filled with shame, fear, guilt, and remorse. Just maybe I can find a way to live where I can have peace of mind, serenity and happiness. Maybe I can find a way to live where I can be sober and have that great sense of ease and comfort that comes at once by taking a couple of drinks. Maybe I can find a way to live where I don't need to take a drink in order to make me feel better. And that's called recovery. 

**Charlie**: As we use our program, as we go through the steps, these kind of feelings down here begin to disappear. And they begin to be replaced with peace of mind, serenity, and happiness. And under those conditions out emotions will not build up to the level that suggests we take a drink to feel better. Because we already feel better. That's what the 12 steps of Alcoholics Anonymous do for us. Fellowship alone will not bring that about. The program will. Let's read the very next statement in the Big Book.
</i>

<blockquote>

**Dr. Silkworth (read by Joe)**: On the other hand--and strange as this may seem to those who do not understand--<span class="bg-promise">once a psychic change has occurred, the very same person who seemed doomed, who had so many problems he despaired of ever solving them, suddenly finds himself easily able to control his desire for alcohol</span>, <span class="bg-direction">the only effort necessary being that required to follow a few simple rules.</span>

</blockquote>

<i>
**Joe**: As Charlie said, those few simple rules are the 12 steps of Alcoholics Anonymous. And our book says that in the 12 and 12. 
</i>

**Joe (reading 12 & 12 Forward)**: <span class="bg-promise">Which, if practiced as a way of life, can expel the obsession to drink and enable the sufferer to become happily and usefully whole.</span>

<i>
**Joe**: And that is called recovery. And that's exactly what the 12 steps of Alcoholics Anonymous is all about.

### Appeal (AR)

<blockquote class="text-muted">
Men have cried out to me in sincere and despairing appeal: "Doctor, I cannot go on like this! I have everything to live for! I must stop, but I cannot! You must help me!"

Faced with this problem, if a doctor is honest with himself, he must sometimes feel his own inadequacy. Although he gives all that is in him, it often is not enough. <span class="bg-promise">One feels that something more than human power is needed to produce the essential psychic change.</span> <span class="bg-warning">Though the aggregate of recoveries resulting from psychiatric effort is considerable, we physicians must admit we have made little impression upon the problem as a whole. Many types do not respond to the ordinary psychological approach.</span>

<span class="bg-warning">I do not hold with those who believe that alcoholism is entirely a problem of mental control. I have had many men who had, for example, worked a period of months on some problem or business deal which was to be settled on a certain date, favorably to them. They took a drink a day or so prior to the date, and then the phenomenon of craving at once became paramount to all other interests so that the important appointment was not met. These men were not drinking to escape; they were drinking to overcome a craving beyond their mental control.</span>

<span class="bg-warning">There are many situations which arise out of the phenomenon of craving which cause men to make the supreme sacrifice rather than continue to fight.</span>

### Classification of alcoholics (AR)

<i>
**Charlie**: Now he goes on a little further on roman numeral 28. And he talkes about 5 different kinds of drinkers. Then he drives this idea of the phenomenon of craving home, being an allergy. One more time, let's look at these 5 drinkers.
</i>

<blockquote>
**Dr. Silkworth (read by Joe)**: The classification of alcoholics seems most difficult, and in much detail is outside the scope of this book. <span class="bg-warning">There are, of course, the psychopaths who are emotionally unstable. We are all familiar with this type. They are always "going on the wagon for keeps." They are over-remorseful and make many resolutions, but never a decision.</span>

<i>
**Charlie**: We call that type 1.
</i>

**Dr. Silkworth (read by Joe)**: <span class="bg-warning">There is the type of man who is unwilling to admit that he cannot take a drink. He plans various ways of drinking. He changes his brand or his environment.</span>

<i>
**Charlie**: That's type 2.
</i>

**Dr. Silkworth (read by Joe)**: <span class="bg-warning">There is the type who always believes that after being entirely free from alcohol for a period of time he can take a drink without danger.</span>

<i>
**Charlie**: Type 3.
</i>

**Dr. Silkworth (read by Joe)**: <span class="bg-warning">There is the manic-depressive type, who is, perhaps, the least understood by his friends, and about whom a whole chapter could be written.</span>

<i>
**Charlie**: That's type 4. I always thought I was the next one, type 5.
</i>

**Dr. Silkworth (read by Joe)**: Then there are types entirely normal in every respect except in the effect alcohol has upon them. They are often able, intelligent, friendly people.

<i>
**Charlie**: God I like that one, isn't that great. Any more type fives in the room tonight? Yeah, a whole bunch of them. Now he makes this point one more time.
</i>

**Dr. Silkworth (read by Charlie)**: <span class="bg-warning">All these, and many others, have one symptom in common: they cannot start drinking without developing the phenomenon of craving. This phenomenon, as we have suggested, may be the manifestation of an allergy which differentiates these people, and sets them apart as a distinct entity. It has never been, by any treatment with which we are familiar, permanently eradicated.</span> <u class="bg-direction">The only relief we have to suggest is entire abstinence.</u>
</blockquote>

<i>
**Charlie**: Now, I think what he said is this: that if all we alcoholics in this room tonight should take a drink--God forbid that happen--but if we did, we would not all react in exactly the same way. 
</i>

<i>
**Charlie**: In just a little bit, one of us would be crying in their beer: "Oh, boo-hoo the world's not treating me right." In just a little bit, one of us would be up there on this stage, hooting and hollering and dancing and cutting up and having a hell of a good time. And in just a little bit, there'd be two over there in that corner getting in a fight, just as sure as anything. Look over here and there'd be a couple--one [putting the make on](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/put#put-the-finger-on-anchor) the other. We tend to do that too when we drink. 
</i>

<i>
**Charlie**: We would do many different things. But if we're real alcoholics, there's one thing that every one of us would do: we would start looking for a second drink. The phenomenon of craving is taking over now. The allergy has manifested itself, and now that we've started, we can't stop. We've gotta have a third drink, and a fourth, and a fifth, and a sixth, and an eighth, and a tenth, and on, and on--until we're drunk, sick, and in all kinds of trouble. 
</i>

<i>
**Charlie**: Now, it really doesn't make any difference whether we're born with it or whether we drink ourselves into it. I was born with it, I'm sure. First drink I took at age 14. The allergy presented itself that night, and I got drunk. Every time I drank, I got drunk. I drank 26 years, I don't ever remember taking just one drink of anything that had alcohol in it. It always led to 2, to 3, to 6, to 8, to 10, etc. 
</i>

<i>
**Charlie**: Some of you, I'm sure, drank with safety for several years. But somewhere, you crossed the line, and the same thing began to happen to you after several years of drinking that happened to me from the very beginning. What difference does it make? The fact is--that's the way we are tonight. 
</i>

<i>
**Charlie**: I know that's the way we are tonight too. Because if we weren't that way tonight, we wouldn't be in this room tonight. If you and I could drink without getting drunk, then where would we be? We'd be out there drinking without getting drunk, but you seem we can't do that. That's what we've got in common in the fellowship of Alcoholics Anonymous--we can't drink without getting drunk. 
</i>

<i>
**Charlie**: Now, back in the 1930s, this was the Doctor's Opinion. In the 1930s, they knew very little about metabolism. Today, they know lots about metabolism. Today, they know that if you put anything in your system--such as a piece of bread or a piece beefsteak--the mind and body recognize what that is. Certain organs of the body begin to produce some things called enzymes. They attack that food, and they begin to break it down and separate it into usable and unusable items. What the body can use--such as the proteins and amino acids, and vitamins--the body will retain. What it can't use, it will dissipate through the urinary and intestinal tract. They call that metabolism. 
</i>

<i>
**Charlie**: <u>Today, they have proven that the Doctor's Opinion is no longer just an opinion</u>--it's actual truth. 
</i>

<i>
**Charlie**: Now we're going to look at a little picture here--this is not A.A. information. A.A. does not want to get into public controversy. But this information was presented to us a few years ago by members of the medical profession. It's so interesting and adds such depth and meaning for people like us, I think that we would be remiss if we didn't look at it. So let's look at it for just a moment. 

**Charlie**: In the center of that picture, there are 9 people who drink safely. They are at ease without alcohol. They take a drink or two, and the mind and body senses it. The enzyme production starts, and the enzymes attack the alcohol, break it down into [acetaldehyde](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetaldehyde), then to [acetoacetic acid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetoacetic_acid), then to [acetone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetone), and the final stages it becomes a simple [carbohydrate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbohydrate) made up of [water](), [sugar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugar), and [carbon dioxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide). The water will be dissipated through the urinary and intestinal tract. The sugar is calories--energy. Empty calories--none of the amino acids, none of the vitamins--but a form of energy. The body will burn them and store the exess as fat to be used at a later date. The carbon dioxide will be dissipated through the lungs. 

**Charlie**: In the normal social drinker, this takes place at a rate of one ounce per hour. I know it will vary with different people, but the average is one ounce per hour. And if they don't drink more than one ounce per hour, then they can't get drunk. Their body metabolizes it, and burns it up, and gets rid of it at that rate. Very seldom do you see a social drinker drinking more than an ounce per hour. If you're with one of them, and they're drinking more than an ounce per hour, you better get out of the way--because they're going to puke on you after a while. They'll either go to sleep, or they'll puke on you, one of the two, every time. 

**Charlie**: Now the left-hand side is the one who does not drink safely. He is at disease without alcohol. And if you want to use the word "disease," that's all it means--something that separates you from the norm. We alcoholics put it in our body, and the same thing happens: the enzymes attack the alcohol, break it down into acetaldehyde, then to acetoacetic acid, then to acetone. It seems as though, in our bodies, the enzymes necessary to complete the metabolism--breaking it down from acetone into the simple carbohydrate--are not there in the same qualities and/or quantities as they are in the body of the non-alcoholic. 

**Charlie**: Therefore, it stays in our bodies for a longer period of time as acetone. It is proven today that acetone, ingested into the human system that remains there for an appreciable period of time will produce an actual physical craving for more of the same. The non-alcoholic's body, it goes through that stage so rapidly that the craving never occurs. In our body, it stays there long enough--the craving develops, and that demands a second drink. 

**Charlie**: Now just think: you've got most of the acetone from the first, and now you put that in from the second. The acetone level goes up, and if the acetone level causes the craving, then the craving becomes harder with the second drink. Now you put in the third. You've got most of the first, nearly all the second, and now you put in the acetone from the third--and the craving goes up. And that demands a fourth. You've got most of the first, nearly all the second, that from the third, and now you put in the acetone from the fourth--and as the acetone level increases, the craving becomes harder. 

**Charlie**: At midnight, we're laying out in the parking lot, they've run over us and broken our leg, and they come running up to us and say
</i>

<i>
**Random people**: Can we help you?
</i>

<i>
**Charlie**: And we say, "God, yes, give me another drink!" You see, now we're craving it harder at midnight after 30 drinks than we were at 6 in the evening after 2 drinks. That explains to me why I never got enough. Hell, I drank for 26 years--I never did get all the alcohol I wanted. I got a hell of a lot more than I needed, more than I could stand, but I never got all I wanted. Because the more you drink, the higher the craving; the higher the craving, the more you want. It's just endless. 

**Charlie**: Now, if this never got any worse, we could probably learn to live with this situation. But we know not only do we have an illness--we have a progressive illness that always gets worse and never better. Today we know that as we drink, the more we drink, the longer we drink, the more tissue we destroy. Alcohol is a destroyer of human tissue. And the more tissue we destroy, it seems as though, that it acts upon two organs of the body first. Which are the [liver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver) and the [pancreas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreas). 

**Charlie**: Now, today we know that the organs of the body that produce the enzymes necessary to metabolize alcohol are the liver and the pancreas. And as we drink, and as we damage them, the enzyme production becomes less and less, the craving becomes harder and harder, the results of drinking become worse and worse. 

**Charlie**: We know also that the body begins to shut down the production of everything as we get older. Now, I wish that were not true, but believe me--it is, I'm experiencing lots of that. If I should take a drink after 20-some-odd years of sobriety, I wouldn't start where I left off 20-some-odd years ago. The craving would be harder, the drinking would be harder, and the resulting trouble would be harder due to the aging factor. 

**Charlie**: So not only do we have a physical illness, we have a progressive physical illness due to two factors: damage to the body, and also due to the aging factor. Now that I see that, I can accept the fact that I can no longer successfully drink alcohol. Until I could see this, I knew there had to be a way that I could drink without getting drunk. And it damn near killed me trying to find it. But now that I can see this, I can accept the fact that I can no longer safely drink alcohol. 

**Charlie**: Now, if that's all that was wrong with me, and all that was wrong with you--then we would pass the hat, get up, and go home, and never have to go to another A.A. meeting. But you see, that's just half of my problem. The other half is right up here in my head. If I never took the first drink, then this allergy couldn't hurt me.
</i>

<i>
**Charlie**: I have a friend who is allergic to all things fish. Every time he eats fish his throat swells up he almost chokes to death but that's not his problem the fact that he's allergic to fish is besides the point because if he doesn't eat fish, then that can't happen to him but he's got something up here in his head that isn't right when it comes to fish. The switch doesn't close or the light bulb doesn't come on or something.
</i>

<i>
**Joe**: He's 3 french fries short of a happy meal.
</i>

<i>
**Charlie**: Yeah. From time to time his mind tells him that it's ok to eat fish. And he'll eat the fish his throat swells up and he ends up in a hospital every time. And I bet it always starts like this.
</i>

<i>
**Fishy friend**: Well I haven't had any fish in 90 days--surely I could have onepiece of fish. It's that orange roughy I've been eating; if I eat nothing but halibut, then it'd be okay. It's those damn people I've been eating fish with. If I just change my crowd...

**Charlie**: Whatever the reason is, his mind gives him permission to do so. Now I'm the same say when it comes to alcohol. Left on my own resources, from time to time my mind tells me

**Charlie's obsession of the mind**: It's okay to drink alcohol.

**Charlie**: Then I take the drink and then the allergy takes over. So the real problem centers in my mind, rather than my body. Let's look at the mind for just a few minutes, and then we'll be through for the night.

**Joe**: In other words, if we have an allergy to alcohol we crave more when we drink. He suggests we don't drink. And that's the end of that. So now we're going to talk about the most dangerous part of the illness. And the most dangerous part of the illness of alcoholism is when we're not drinking. You know why it's the most dangerous part of the illness? Because we're thinking about drinking. So let's move back now to the page roman numeral 26, and we're going to start talking about the mind. Two-fold illness. We've talked about the physical allergy in great detail, now we're going to talk about the obsession of the mind. Page roman numeral 26.

### Doomed (AR)

<div class="text-muted">
This immediately precipitates us into a seething caldron of debate. Much has been written pro and con, but among physicians, the general opinion seems to be that most chronic alcoholics are doomed.

What is the solution? Perhaps I can best answer this by relating one of my experiences.
</div>

### Gastric hemorrhage (AR)

<div class="text-muted">
About one year prior to this experience a man was brought in to be treated for chronic alcoholism. He had but partially recovered from a gastric hemorrhage and seemed to be a case of pathological lmental deterioration. He had lost everything worthwhile in life and was only living, one might say, to drink. He frankly admitted and believed that for him there was no hope. Following the elimination of alcohol, there was found to be no permanent brain injury. He accepted the plan outlined in this book. One year later he called to see me, and I experienced a very strange sensation. I knew the man by name, and partly recognized his features, but there all resemblance ended. From a trembling, despairing, nervous wreck, had emerged a man brimming over with self-reliance and contentment. I talked with him for some time, but was not able to bring myself to feel that I had known him before. To me he was a stranger, and so he left me. A long time has passed with no return to alcohol.
</div>

### Desperate condition (AR)

<div class="text-muted">
When I need a mental uplift, I often think of another case brought in by a physician prominent in New York. The patient had made his own diagnosis, and deciding his situation hopeless, had hidden in a deserted barn determined to die. He was rescued by a searching party, and, in desperate condition, brought to me. Following his physical rehabilitation, he had a talk with me in which he frankly stated he thought the treatment a waste of effort, unless I could assure him, which no one ever had, that in the future he would have the "will power" to resist the impulse to drink.

His alcoholic problem was so complex, and his depression so great, that we felt his only hope would be through what we then called "moral psychology," and we doubted if even that would have any effect.

However, he did become "sold" on the ideas contained in this book. He has not had a drink for a great many years. I see him now and then and he is as fine a specimen of manhood as one could wish to meet.

I earnestly advise every alcoholic to read this book through, and though perhaps he came to scoff, he may remain to pray.
